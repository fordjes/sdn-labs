### MONDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

Welcome to the Alta3 Software Defined Networking Labs! Before we get started, let's review some basics:

Each lab is structured with a *Title*, *Day*, *Lab Objective*, and *Procedure*.

   - **Title** - Indicates if this lab is Required, Optional (Basic), or Optional (Advanced)
      - **Required - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;** - Marked with a Gold Star emoji. Everyone must do these labs! These labs build on one another, so don't skip any!
      - **Optional (Basic) - &#x1F528;OPTIONAL&#x1F528;** - Marked with a Hammer emoji. Do these labs if you are new to Linux or the Command Line Interface. Failure to do these labs by inexperienced users is guaranteed to cause greater problems in other labs!
      - **Optional (Advanced) - &#x1F680;OPTIONAL&#x1F680;** - Marked with a Rocket Ship emoji. Do these labs if you're a Rocket Scientist and are looking for more than just the basics (i.e. "You're a wizard, Harry")
   - **Day** - Informs you as to which day you should be completing this lab. 
   - **Lab Objective** - Justifies why this is an important task to learn and the ultimate goal of the procedure.
   - **Procedure** - Numbered steps to follow.

The objective of this lab is to instruct students on how to access their lab environment from a Windows, Linux, or Apple platform. All you will need to perform the labs is a browser. The flavor of the browser is up to you, but if you have any issues, it is recommended you first switch to Chrome or Firefox.

Although it is not required, the labs might be a tad easier if you have a second monitor available for use.

### Procedure

0. Here is your SDN lab environment: 

  ![Lab Environment](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_00_openstack_desktop.png)

0. If you've already signed into the remote desktop (lab environment), then skip this step. Otherwise, while **holding down the control key**, click the following link to gain access to your remote desktop "beachhead". https://alta3.com/beachhead
    
0. If you've already signed into the remote desktop (lab environment), then skip this step. Otherwise, you should be connected to a screen that looks like the following:

  ![Lab Environment](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_00_a_lab_desktop_signin.png)

0. If you've already signed into the remote desktop (lab environment), then skip this step. Otherwise, you now need to sign into your remote desktop environment. The sign-in name and password will be provided by your instructor. Keep note of these, they will not change for the remainder of the course.

0. Now that you are signed in, we recommend you tap **F11** to place yourself in full-screen mode. Fullscreen mode will make the lab environment the easiest to control. This is where the second monitor will come in handy. Unfortunately, Microsoft Edge (the new Internet Explorer browser packaged with Windows 10) doesn't allow a full screen mode. Again, if at all possible, we recommend using Firefox or Chrome to complete the OpenStack labs.
 
0. Answer the following questions to confirm that you understand the lab environment:
  - **Q1: How many browser tabs will you have open to do these labs?**
    - A1: One. The tab to my remote desktop environment (called 'beachhead'), and if possible, this tab should be in full screen mode.
  - **Q2: Can I use the Microsoft Edge browser to complete the labs?**
    - A2: Yes. You CAN use Microsoft Edge to complete the labs, however, there are better options such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
  - **Q3: If I get pulled out of class for an emergency, can I resume labs later this evening?**
    - A3: Sure can! However, these labs build on one another, so please focus on completing the labs during class time.
  - **Q4: Will I need to SSH into other environments?**
    - A4: At first, no. You'll spend most of your time working on the remote desktop (beachhead). If you need to SSH to a different location, the lab will let you know how/when to do so.
    
0. That's it for this lab! Feel free to continue onto *Lab 01* by pressing the *Next* link when you are certain you understand how the environment is deployed.
