### MONDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to demonstrate how to use the tcpdump tool, as this will be one of the many CLI tools we'll be working with in this class. Tcpdump prints out a description of the contents of packets on a network interface that match a boolean expression. The files saved by tcpdump are **\*.pcap files** which many users may recognize from working with Wireshark.

When tcpdump finishes capturing packets, it will report counts of:

  - **packets 'captured'** - The number of packets that tcpdump has received and processed.
  - **packets 'received by filter'** - The meaning of this depends on the OS on which you're running tcpdump, and possibly on the way the OS was configured - if a filter was specified on the command line, on some OSes it counts packets regardless of whether they were matched by the filter expression and, even if they were matched by the filter expression, regardless of whether tcpdump has read and processed them yet, on other OSes it counts only packets that were matched by the filter expression regardless of whether tcpdump has read and processed them yet, and on other OSes it counts only packets that were matched by the filter expression and were processed by tcpdump).
  - **packets 'dropped by kernel'** - This is the number of packets that were dropped, due to a lack of buffer space, by the packet capture mechanism in the OS on which tcpdump is running, if the OS reports that information to applications; if not, it will be reported as 0.

### Procedure

0. Close any terminals you have open. Open a new terminal, and then change to the home directory.

  `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. We can start by version checking the instance of *tcpdump* installed, as well as review the usage.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `tcpdump -h`
 
0. See the list of interfaces that *tcpdump* can listen on with the *-D* argument.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -D`

0. Lets capture packets on all interfaces by using the any option:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any`

0. Whoa! So much traffic. Press **CTRL + C** to quit.

0. Instead of letting TCP dump run until interuppted, you can use lower case c option to specify the number of packets you'd like to capture:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -c 5`

0. Usually it is easier to work with IP addresses and port numbers instead of these names. The lower case n option will take care of this:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -c 5 -n`

0. Let's augment the command further to just capture the first 96 bites of every packet is captured:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -c 5 -n -s96`

0. Let's clean up the screen, and go in a new direction.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `clear`

0. For an example, lets generate some traffic over the eth1 interface:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -n -t`

0. The next fields are the sequence and acknowledgement numbers. TCPDUMP by default uses relative numbers here. Lets look at an example:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -c 20 -n tcp and dst port 5900 -t`
  
  - **Q1: What is port 5900?**
    - A1: Port 5900 is used for the VNC client that you are using to view the remote desktop session.

0. Relative sequence numbers can be turned off with the uppercase S option

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -c 20 -n tcp and dst port 5900 -S`

0. Lets look at sample output for DNS requests. Here is a capture on all interfaces (-i any), port 53 (port 53), displaying IP addresses in lieu of names (-n), and capturing only 50 packets (-c 50):

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any port 53 -n -c 50`
  
0. It is more than likely that *tcpdump* will just sit as you're not making DNS requests. Within your remote desktop, click the Firefox icon.

0. Navigate to **www.google.com**, and search for **alta3 research**

0. By now tcp dump will have stopped capturing.
  
  > If you accidently started tcpdump to capture more than 50 packets, you can press **CTRL + C** to quit tcpdump.

0. Often, tcpdump is used to save captures to a file for later analysis. This is done using the lower case w option. The following command will capture on any interface (-i any), will writeout the capture to the file capture.pcap (-w capture.pcap), and capture a total of 5 packets (-c 5):

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -w capture.pcap -c 5`

0. When writing packets to a file, the lower case v option (-v) runs a counter, which reflects the number of packets captured. The following command will capture on any interface (-i any), will writeout the capture to the file capture.pcap (-w capture.pcap), will display a packet capture counter (-v), and capture a total of 5 packets (-c 5):

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -w capture.pcap -v -c 5`

0. We can limit a file size with the captial C option (-C). Before writing a raw packet to a savefile, tcpdump will check if file is currently larger than file_size and, if so, *close the current savefile and open a new one*. Savefiles after the first savefile will have the name specified with the -w flag, with a number after it, starting at 1 and continuing upward. The units of file_size are millions of bytes (1,000,000 bytes, not 1,048,576 bytes). The following command will create 10Mb files (-C 10) named *capture_10Mb.pcap*

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -w capture_10Mb.pcap -v -C 10`

0. The above command will go on indefinately, so press **CTRL + C** to quit tcpdump.

0. Existing capture files can be read with the -r option. The follow command asks to readout (-r) the file capture.pcap, and display the IP addresses of the interfaces in lieu of their names (-n):

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -n -r capture.pcap`

0. Packets go by too quickly on large files, so let's use a pipe (usually found above the *ENTER* key) and the less command. This will allow us to scroll up and down (with the arrow keys) through the capture:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -n -r capture.pcap | less`
  
  >
  When you are done using the less utility, you can press **q** to quit.
  
0. The information returned by tcpdump can be overwhelming, so let's try applying some filters to the type of traffic we wish to capture. The host keyword can be used to specify traffic going to or from a specific IP. The following command says to capture traffic on any interface (-i any), display IP addresses in lieu of names (-n), to only capture traffic with a source or destination of 172.16.1.4 (host 172.16.1.4), and to only capture a total of 5 packets (-c 5):

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -n host 172.16.1.4 -c 5`

0. It is more than likely that the above command will capture 5 packets almost immediately, but if it doesn't, you can press **CTRL + C** to quit tcpdump.

0. With our last command, all of the traffic not relating to 10.0.0.3 is being ignored for analysis. This command can be augmented by the source (src) and destination (dst) keywords. This is the same capture as before except now you added the source (src) keyword; only traffic with a source IP of 172.16.1.14 will be captured.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -n src host 172.16.1.4 -c 5`

0. It is more than likely that the above command will capture 5 packets almost immediately, but if it doesn't, you can press **CTRL + C** to quit tcpdump.

0. This is the same capture as before except now you added the destination (dst) keyword; only traffic with a destination IP of 172.16.1.14 will be captured.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -n dst host 172.16.1.4 -c 5`

0. It is more than likely that the above command will capture 5 packets almost immediately, but if it doesn't, you can press **CTRL + C** to quit tcpdump.

0. Filter expressions also support the use of the logical operators, such as *and*, and *or*. The following command will capture on any interface (-i any), display IP in lieu of names (-n), capture packets exchanged between the hosts 172.16.1.4 and 172.16.1.5, and capture a total of only 5 packets (-c 5).  

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -n host 172.16.1.4 and host 172.16.1.5 -c 5`

0. The above command should terminate after a minute or two, if you'd like to speed up the process, open Firefox within the remote desktop, and navigate to **http://controller/horizon** which should cause tcpdump to close immediately. Alternatively, you can press **CTRL + C** to quit capturing with tcpdump.

0. Filters can be used to isolate traffic to define TCP or UDP ports. Here, only port 80 traffic is captured:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -n host 172.16.1.4 and port 80 -c 5`

0. As before, to create http traffic, open Firefox within the remote desktop, and navigate to **http://controller/horizon** which should cause tcpdump to close immediately. Alternatively, you can press **CTRL + C** to quit capturing with tcpdump.

0. Here is an example of a compound expression:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -n "host 172.16.1.4 and (port 80 or 443)" -c 5`
  
0. As before, to create http traffic, open Firefox within the remote desktop, and navigate to **http://controller/horizon** which should cause tcpdump to close immediately. Alternatively, you can press **CTRL + C** to quit capturing with tcpdump.

0. More filters can be used to include or ignore an entire subnet:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -n -c 5 "src net 172.16.0.0/16 and not dst net 192.168.0.0/16"`

0. Filters can be applied based on MAC addresses by using the **ether host** keyword:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i ens3 ether host 28:16:2e:1f:25:49 -n -c 10`

0. The above command will go on indefinately, as that MAC address was one that was made up, so press **CTRL + C** to quit tcpdump.

0. To see MAC addresses in captures, we use the lower case e option:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -n -c 5 -e`

0. More filters include protocol type. These can include keywords such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP and RARP. The follwoing captures only IPv6 traffic:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any ip6`

0. The above command will go on indefinately, so press **CTRL + C** to quit tcpdump.

0. Just a few final thoughts. The -v option can be used to increase more detail or verbosity in packet captures. Three v's is max verbosity (-vvv):

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -c 5 -vvv`

0. Just a few final thoughts. The quiet option (-q) can be used to provide a minimal 'quiet display' output:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -c 15 -q`

0. Lastly we'll look at the timestamp display option which uses lowercase t (-t). Types of timestamping supports are:

  - **(-t)** - Don't print a time stamp on each line
  - **(-tt)** - Print the timestamp as seconds from January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC
  - **(-ttt)** - Print a delta (micro-second resolution) between current and previous line
  - **(-tttt)** - Print a timestamp, as hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second since midnight
  - **(-ttttt)** - Print a delta (micro-second resolution) between current and first line

0. Issue the following command, which will not display a timestamp.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any -c 5 -q -t`

0. Finally, here are some filters based on tcp flags:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i any "tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-syn !=0"`

  - **Q1: What does the above command do?**
    - A1: TCP Dump, and look for a TCP flag that indicates a TCP-SYN message (creating a connection).

0. **Without** closing your current terminal, open a second terminal, and run *nc* (netcat) to create a connection to the indicated port. First target port 80.

  `student@beachhead:/$` `nc 10.0.0.3 80`
  
0. Press **CTRL + C** To quit. Now target port 801.

  `student@beachhead:/$` `nc 10.0.0.3 801`

0. Press **CTRL + C** To quit. Now target port 802.

  `student@beachhead:/$` `nc 10.0.0.3 802`

0. Back on your first terminal, press **CTRL + C** to quit *tcpdump*. Run this next command, which only looks for TCP resets:

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -vnni any "tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-rst !=0"`

  - **Q1: What do the vnni flags do?**
    - A1: No name resolutions. No port resolutions. A bit more verbosity (time to live, protocol, and length).
  - **Q2: Where could I go to confirm this?**
    - A2: Type *man tcpdump*

0. Once again, **without** closing your current terminal, open a second terminal, and run *nc* (netcat) to create a connection to the indicated port. First, target port 803.

  `student@beachhead:/$` `nc 10.0.0.3 803`
  
0. Press **CTRL + C** To quit. Now target port 804.

  `student@beachhead:/$` `nc 10.0.0.3 804`
  
0. Good job! That's it for this lab! Close all the open windows within your remote desktop environment.
