### MONDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to explore virtual interfaces (veth) within Linux. Virtual interfaces are typically used when you are trying to connect two entities via an interface to forward/receive frames. These entities could be containers/bridges/ovs-switch etc. Say you want to connect a docker/lxc container to OVS. You can create a veth pair and push the first interface to the docker/lxc (say, as a phys interface) and push the other interface to OVS. Linux interfaces created with *ip tuntap* (tap) cannot be used to attach to network namespaces, so we are dependent on veth pairs.

### Procedure

0. Close any terminals you currently have open within the remote desktop session.

0. From your remote desktop, open a new terminal session, and move to the student home directory.

  `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. We're about to create a virtal ethernet interface (veth). Think of a veth interface like a cat-6e cable. When you create a veth, think of it like creating one cable, with two interfaces.

  >
  Before we go issuing commands, make sure this is the picture you have in your mind.
  
  ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Openflow veth is a cat-6e Cable](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_veth02.png) 

  - **Q1: Suppose I hand you a cat-6e cable. How many cables did I just hand you?**
    - A1: Just one.
  - **Q2: How many interfaces are on that cable?**
    - A2: Assuming the cable is going to be useful, it needs two (2) ends. So two interfaces.
  - **Q3: So you could name both interfaces differently (both ends of the wire)?**
    - A3: Sure! We could name it something really creative, like *left-end* and *right-end*, or maybe *veth1* and *veth2*.

0. Begin by creating a pair of virtual ethernet interfaces. From this lab forward, we will issue all of our commands with the updated iproute2 toolkit.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `ip link add veth1 type veth peer name veth2`
  
  >
  This networking stuff is hard enough without having to visualize it in our heads. The illustration below is a depiction of the command you just issued:
  
  ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Openflow veth Creation](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_veth01.png)
    
  - **Q1: How many *veths* did you just create?**
    - A1: Just one! Because I'm thinking of a *veth* like I think of a cat-6e cable.
  - **Q2: When one veth is created, how many interfaces are created along with it?**
    - Q2: Two. Just like the cat-6e cable.
  - **Q3: If someone 'deleted' one half of your cat-6e cable (smashed one of the RJ-45 boots), what would you do with the cable?**
    - A3: Throw it in the trash.
  - **Q4: So later on, when we 'delete' one of these veth interfaces, what will happen to the other interface?**
    - A4: Both interfaces will be *deleted*, just like the cable being thrown in the trash if one boot is broken.

0. Nothing special is displayed to the screen for issuing the previous command. To see the results, use the *ip link* command. The pair of interfaces we just created should be named veth1 and veth2.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `ip link list`

  ```
  1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
  2: ens3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether fa:16:3e:6f:47:52 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  3: ens4: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:75:2a:67 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  4: veth2@veth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 7a:a9:ff:dd:05:96 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  5: veth1@veth2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 76:83:83:20:f1:4b brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  ```  
    
  - **Q1: How many new interfaces showed up**
    - A1: Two! veths must appear in pairs!

0. If you'll notice, both of these interfaces are down. Let's bring up both interfaces. First, turn up veth1.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `ip link set dev veth1 up`

0. Again. Nothing special is displayed. If we want to see the results of our command, we need to issue the *ip link* command once again. Do so, and take notice to the state of the veth1 interface. The state of the interface should now be listed as LOWERLAYERDOWN.

  ```
  1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
  2: ens3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether fa:16:3e:59:a0:b8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  3: ens4: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether fa:16:3e:ac:cb:ff brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  4: veth2@veth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:71:53:d6:3b:c2 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  5: veth1@veth2: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state LOWERLAYERDOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether a6:c7:fa:98:86:af brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  ```

0. The state LOWERLAYERDOWN can be resolved to the more desireable state of UP by turning up the interface peered with veth1, veth2. Let's do that now. 

  `student@beachhead:~$` `ip link set dev veth2 up`

0. Check out your work. Both interfaces should be displaying a state of UP.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `ip link show`

  ```
  1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
  2: ens3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether fa:16:3e:6f:47:52 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  3: ens4: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:75:2a:67 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  4: veth2@veth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 7a:a9:ff:dd:05:96 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  5: veth1@veth2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 76:83:83:20:f1:4b brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  ```
  
0. Let's apply an IP address to each interface. First to the veth1 interface.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `ip addr add 172.16.2.11/24 dev veth1`
  
  >
  If you're lost, the following illustration should put you back on track. The previous command applied an IP address (L3) to one side of our veth (cat-6e cable) named *veth1*.

  ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Openflow veth IP application 01](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_veth03.png) 

0. There won't be any special print-out from the previous command. Before we review our work, apply an IP address to the veth2 interface.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `ip addr add 172.16.2.12/24 dev veth2`
  
  >
  So once again, if you're lost, the following illustration should put you back on track. The previous command applied an IP address (L3) to the other side of our veth (cat-6e cable) named *veth2*.

  ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Openflow veth IP application 02](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_veth04.png) 

0. Issuing *ip addr list* will display the same information as *ip link show*, but will also include the L3 IP information.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `ip addr list`
  
  ```
  1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

      inet6 fe80::a4c7:faff:fe98:86af/64 scope link
         valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   ```

0. Time to examine the results of our work. Issue the following commands, and answer the assocaited questions along the way.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `ip addr show veth1`
  
  ```
  4: veth1@veth2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 76:83:83:20:f1:4b brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.16.2.11/24 scope global veth1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::7483:83ff:fe20:f14b/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
  ```
    
0. Answer the following questions:

  - **Q1: What is the MAC address assigned to the veth1 interface?**
    - A1: The one applied in the example is 76:83:83:20:f1:4b, however yours will be different (MACs are unique)
  - **Q2: Where did this MAC address come from?**
    - A2: This MAC is randomly generated, they do no belong to any OUI (Oganizational Unit Identifer). In the first octet, if the second nibble is a **2, 6, a or an e**, it can be randomly created and used.
  - **Q3: Is it possible to change this MAC address if we wanted to?**
    - A3: Certainly it is. A command like *ip link set dev veth1 addr 00:01:02:aa:bb:cc* would set the MAC associated with veth1 to 00:01:02:aa:bb:cc.
  - **Q4: How many namespaces are being utilized in this lab?**
    - A4: Just one (1). The default (root) namespace. By the way, if you don't know what a Linux *namespace* is yet, that's okay. Just getting this concept clearly in everyone's mind.
    
0. Let's not neglect the other half of our hard work. Use the *ip addr* command to display information regarding the veth2 interface.

   `student@beachhead:~$` `ip addr show veth2`
  
  ```
  5: veth2@veth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 7a:a9:ff:dd:05:96 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.16.2.12/24 scope global veth2
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::78a9:ffff:fedd:596/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
  ``` 

0. Let's try using a ping command to create traffic between the two interfaces. Let's first examine the usage of the ping command.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `ping -help`

0. So the following command should ask veth2 to ping 172.16.2.11. However, this command will **not** work! And that's the point. We're trying to emphasize that *veth* we created is just a dumb cable. If what you're doing is unclear, check out the included illustration below for clarity.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `ping -I veth2 172.16.2.11`
  
  >
  The illustration below should reveal why we would never expect this experiment to 'work'.
  
  ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Openflow veth Ping](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_veth05.png)

0. Now confirm that we **cannot** ping in either direction. If you're lost, again, the illustration below should help clear things up.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `ping -I veth1 172.16.2.12`

  >
  This second illustration should reveal why we would never expect this experiment to 'work' in either direction.
  
  ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Openflow veth Ping](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_veth06.png)

0. Answer the following question:

    - **Q1: So why didn't the ping command work between the two interfaces?**
      - A1: It won't ever work. We created a dumb cable called an 'veth', and we're watching it ARP for itself. Take away is that the veth can be used to make a connection. Other than that, it's really dumb (just like a cat-6e cable).

0. We did learn how to use TCPdump. Let's see if we can't use those skils to see unaswered ARPs going out one end of our veth. Run this next command, which once again asks *veth2* to send an ICMP packet to IP address *172.16.2.11*. As this one half of a veth, we expect it to 'exit' via its connected interface *veth1*, which has been assigned the IP address *172.16.2.11*. The second half of the command will allow the ping to run in the background (* > /dev/null &*).

  `student@beachhead:~$` `ping -I veth2 172.16.2.11 > /dev/null &`

0. Now run TCPdump, and capture traffic on the *veth2* interface.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo tcpdump -i veth2`
  
0. You should see a long list of unanswered ARPs. Press **CTRL + C** to stop TCPdump.

0. Type the following command to bring the *ping* tool back into the foreground.
    
  `student@beachhead:~$` `fg`
  
0. Press **CTRL + C** to stop the *ping* command.

0. Remove all the virtual interfaces (back to scratch)

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip link del veth1`

  - **Q1: Why do we only need to run the delete once?**
    - A1: Think of it in terms of a wire. You only need to delete one side of the wire to get rid of the entire wire.

0. `student@beachhead:~$` `ip link show`
  
    ```
    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1
        link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    2: ens3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether fa:16:3e:6f:47:52 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    3: ens4: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 08:00:27:75:2a:67 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    ```
    
0. Good job! That's it for this lab.
