### MONDAY - &#x1F680;OPTIONAL&#x1F680;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is very similar to the Open vSwitch lab, however it takes a much deeper dive into OVS concepts. This lab has been designed for advanced students, and therefore is *not* required. This lab assumes you understand the configuration steps in the "Lab 05 - Open vSwitch (OVS)" lab. Therefore, only attempt this lab after you have finished its "basic" counterpart.

### Procedure

0. Close any terminals and Firefox windows you currently have open within the remote desktop session.

0. From your remote desktop, open a new terminal session and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. We explored this in the last lab, but just to cover all our bases. In this lab, we'll be using a little code snippet we invented called the *a3diff function*. If you tail the .bashrc file, you'll see it at the end. Just something we want you to be aware of, as we'll be using it in this lab to compare the output of some iproute2 commands.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `tail .bashrc`

    ```
    function a3diff {
        wdiff -n $1 $2 | colordiff
    }
    ```
    >
    If you're not a programmer, no big deal. All you have to know is that this little code snippit will save us some keystrokes and allow us to do two (2) things:
    >
    1) Look for within-line differences (`wdiff`)   
    >
    2) Display the results in color (`colordiff`)

0. While we eventually want to create an OVS Bridge with virtual interfaces, let's first collect information about our current configuration. First display the L2 information.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip link list`
  
0. Great, now display L3 information.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip addr show`

0. Finally, show the current state of the routing table.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip route show`
  
    ```
    default via 172.16.1.1 dev ens3
    169.254.169.254 via 172.16.1.1 dev ens3
    172.16.1.0/24 dev ens3  proto kernel  scope link  src 172.16.1.4
    ```

0.  The ovs-vsctl is the utility used for querying and configuring ovs-vswitchd, so let's start with reviewing usage.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-vsctl -help`

0. Let's display the version of OVS software we are using as well as show the state of OVS switches tracked by the OVS database.
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-vsctl show`
  
    ```
    a00e3ca2-3926-4d0d-9f71-a2105f6c6166
      ovs_version: "2.5.0"
    ```

0. Save the current L2 configuration in a file called *ovs-link-init*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip link list > /tmp/ovs2-link-init`

0. Save the current L3 configuration in a file called *ovs-addr-init*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip addr show > /tmp/ovs2-addr-init`

0. Save the current routing information in a file called *ovs-route-init*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip route show > /tmp/ovs2-route-init`

0. Finally, save the current state of OVS confirmation in a file called *ovs-show-init*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-vsctl show > /tmp/ovs2-show-init`

0. Now let's create some network namespaces. In keeping in the spirit of our previous labs, we'll call this namespace *peach*

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns add peach`
  
0. And we'll need a second name space called *bowser*.  
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns add bowser`
  
0. Create an Open vSwitch bridge. The following command instructs Open vSwitch to create a bridge named *donut-plains*.
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-vsctl add-br donut-plains`
  
0. Okay, so now let's create two veth pairs for adding into the namespaces.  
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip link add eth0-peach type veth peer name veth-peach`
  
0. Create another veth pair.  
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip link add eth0-bowser type veth peer name veth-bowser`

0. Add the veths into the network namespaces. First set the *eth0-peach* veth into the network namespace *peach*

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip link set eth0-peach netns peach`
  
0. Add the second veth, *eth0-bowser*, into the network namespace *bowser*.  
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip link set eth0-bowser netns bowser`
  
0. Add the namespace interfaces to the Open vSwitch bridge. First we'll add *veth-peach* to our Open Vswitch bridge named *donut-plains*.
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-vsctl add-port donut-plains veth-peach`

0. Now add *veth-bowser* to our Open vSwitch bridge named *donut-plains*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-vsctl add-port donut-plains veth-bowser`
  
0. Apply *VLAN tag 50* to *veth-peach*.
  
     `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-vsctl set port veth-peach tag=50`

0. Apply *VLAN tag 150* to *veth-bowser*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-vsctl set port veth-bowser tag=150`
    
0. All of the steps you just executed are the ones from the *basic* version of this lab. Still, here is a visual of what you have setup so far.
  
    ![Alta3 Research OVS Advanced Setup](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_ovs_advanced01.png)

0. Bring all the interfaces up and examine the changes. The following command will place the *veth-peach* interface in an UP state.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip link set veth-peach up`
  
0. The following command will place the *veth-bowser* interface in an UP state.
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip link set veth-bowser up`
  
0. The following command will place the *eth0-peach* interface within the network namespace *peach* in an UP state.  
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns exec peach ip link set dev eth0-peach up`
  
0. The following command will place the *eth0-bowser* interface within the network namespace *bowser* in an UP state.  
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns exec bowser ip link set dev eth0-bowser up`

0. Copy the current state of L2 to the file *ovs2-link-config*.
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip link list > /tmp/ovs2-link-config`
  
0. Copy the current state of L3 (IP) to the file *ovs2-addr-config*.  
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip addr show > /tmp/ovs2-addr-config`
  
0. Copy the current state of IP routing to the file *ovs2-route-config*.  
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip route show > /tmp/ovs2-route-config`
  
0. Copy the current state of the Open vSwitch configuration to the file *ovs2-show-config*.
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-vsctl show > /tmp/ovs2-show-config`
  
0. Run the *a3diff* file to see how L2 configuration has changed since we started this lab.  
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `a3diff /tmp/ovs2-link-init /tmp/ovs2-link-config`

0. Run the *a3diff* file to see how L3 (IP) configuration has changed since we started this lab.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `a3diff /tmp/ovs2-addr-init /tmp/ovs2-addr-config`

0. Run the *a3diff* file to see how the IP routing configuration has changed since we started this lab.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `a3diff /tmp/ovs2-route-init /tmp/ovs2-route-config`

0. Run the *a3diff* file to see how the Open vSwitch configuration has changed since we started this lab.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `a3diff /tmp/ovs2-show-init /tmp/ovs2-show-config`

0. Let's create two new network namespaces. Eventually we're going to configure DHCP servcies within these spaces, so let's name them appropriately. First, create a new network namespace named *dhcp-peach*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns add dhcp-peach`

0. Great! Now create another network namespace named, *dhcp-bowser*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns add dhcp-bowser`

0. Open vSwtich *internal* interfaces, like *dhcp-peach*, can appear as “physical” interfaces to the Linux host, and therefore can be assigned IP addresses and used for communication. We'll assign IP addresses to these interfaces a bit later. For now, create the internal OVS interfaces for a pair of DHCP servers to run on. This first command creates the *dhcp-peach* OVS internal interface.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-vsctl add-port donut-plains dhcp-peach -- set interface dhcp-peach type=internal`

0. Now create the *dhcp-bowser* OVS internal interface.
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-vsctl add-port donut-plains dhcp-bowser -- set interface dhcp-bowser type=internal`

0. Apply VLAN tag 50 to the *dhcp-peach* interface.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-vsctl set port dhcp-peach tag=50`

0. Apply VLAN tag 150 to the *dhcp-bowser* interface.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-vsctl set port dhcp-bowser tag=150`

0. At this point, the ovs ports are created, but not yet pushed into a namespace, so lets take a snapshot of the current links before they "disappear" into their namespaces.  

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip link show > /tmp/ovs2-link-dhcp`

0. OVS interal interfaces can exist in their own namespace, and maintain connectivity without the creation of a veth pair. To proove this, try moving the OVS interface into the dhcp-peach namespace.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip link set dhcp-peach netns dhcp-peach`

0. Again, OVS interal interfaces can exist in their own namespace, and maintain connectivity without the creation of a veth pair. To prove this, try moving the OVS interface into the dhcp-bowser namespace.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip link set dhcp-bowser netns dhcp-bowser`

0. Writeout the current Open vSwitch configuration to a file called, *ovs-show-dhcp*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-vsctl show > /tmp/ovs-show-dhcp`

0. Run the *a3diff* function to see how the OVS configuration has changed since the internal interfaces were created and VLAN tags applied. 

    `student@beachhead:~$` `a3diff /tmp/ovs2-show-config /tmp/ovs-show-dhcp`

0. Now that the ovs-dhcp ports are plugged into their namespaces, lets writeout the L2 configuration to a file to compare the before and after changes.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip link show > /tmp/ovs-link-dhcp-ns`

0. Run the *a3diff* function to see how the L2 configuration has changed since the dhcp interfaces were created with their VLAN tags applied vs when they were plugged into their appropriate namespaces. 

    `student@beachhead:~$` `a3diff /tmp/ovs2-link-dhcp /tmp/ovs-link-dhcp-ns`

0. Bring up DHCP interface *dhcp-peach* within the network namespace *dhcp-peach*.  

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns exec dhcp-peach ip link set dev dhcp-peach up`

0. Apply the IP address *172.16.2.50* to the *dhcp-peach* interface.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns exec dhcp-peach ip addr add 172.16.2.50/24 dev dhcp-peach`

0. Bring up DHCP interface *dhcp-bowser* within the network namespace *dhcp-bowser*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns exec dhcp-bowser ip link set dev dhcp-bowser up`

0. Apply the IP address *172.16.2.150* to the *dhcp-bowser* interface.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns exec dhcp-bowser ip addr add 172.16.2.150/24 dev dhcp-bowser`
    
0. Seems like a good time for an illustration. 

    ![Alta3 Research OVS Advanced DHCP Setup](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_ovs_advanced02.png)

0. A lightweight DHCP and caching DNS server, *dnsmasq* service provides network infrastructure for small networks: DNS, DHCP, router advertisement and network boot. It is designed to be lightweight and have a small footprint, suitable for resource constrained routers and firewalls. It has also been widely used for tethering on smartphones and portable hotspots, and to support virtual networking in virtualization frameworks. Supported platforms include Linux (with glibc and uclibc), Android, BSD, and Mac OS X. In the next step, start the *dnsmasq* service in the *dhcp-peach* network namespace.
  
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns exec dhcp-peach dnsmasq --interface=dhcp-peach --dhcp-range=172.16.2.51,172.16.2.149,255.255.255.0`

0. Start the *dnsmasq* service in the *dhcp-peach* network namespace.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns exec dhcp-bowser dnsmasq --interface=dhcp-bowser --dhcp-range=172.16.2.151,172.16.2.249,255.255.255.0`

0. This performs DHCP discovery within the L2 broadcast domain. This command demonstrates connectivity across the veth, across the bridge (inside the VLAN), and into the *dhcp-peach* namespace via an OVS internal port.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns exec peach dhclient eth0-peach`

0. Return the L3 (IP address) information within the *dhcp-peach* namespace. You should see an IP address applied between 172.16.2.51 and 172.16.2.149 applied to the *eth0-peach* interface.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns exec peach ip addr`
    
0. This performs DHCP discovery within the L2 broadcast domain. This command demonstrates connectivity across the veth, across the bridge (inside the VLAN), and into the *dhcp-bowser* namespace via an OVS internal port.  
    
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns exec bowser dhclient eth0-bowser`
    
0. Return the L3 (IP address) information within the *dhcp-bowser* namespace. You should see an IP address applied between 172.16.2.151 and 172.16.2.249 applied to the *eth0-bowser* interface. 
    
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns exec bowser ip addr`
 
0. In later labs, we're going to start studying Open vSwitch OpenFlow tables. Let's show these 'flows' from the OVS switch, *donut-plains*.
    
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-ofctl dump-flows donut-plains`
    
    >
    If very little, or nothing is displayed. That's okay! We didn't really agument the Open vSwitch to do anything more than the baseline configuration.
  
0. Well that was fun! Time to clean up our system. Running all of the steps from here down will remove all of our configuration.

0. Trash the network namespace *peach*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns del peach`

0. Trash the network namespace *bowser*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns del bowser`

0. Trash the L2 interface *veth-peach*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip link del veth-peach`

0. Trash the L2 interface *veth-bowser*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip link del veth-bowser`

0. Finally, trash the bridge *donut-plains*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ovs-vsctl del-br donut-plains`

0. You should be right back to the way things were before you started this lab. If anything was unclear, run it again!
