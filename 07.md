### TUESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to introduce how to use Wireshark for packet capture and decoding. Wireshark is essentially TCPdump, only with a GUI. Just like TCPdump, it too can writeout, open, and manipulate packet capture files (.pcap). In this lab, you will learn how to use Wireshark to listen on interfaces, set display filters, create a Wireshark profile so you can save your layout customization (color, windows placement, etc.), colorize packets by protocol, and set-up a friendly environment for capturing the OpenFlow protocol. Wireshark is an industry standard tool; the lessons learned within this lab are directly applicable within many production environments.

### Procedure

0. Take a moment to clean up your remote Desktop. For now, close all other terminal spaces or windows you might have open.

0. Open a new terminal then *cd* to the home student directory

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. The Wireshark Wiki has many sample captures available for download. Before we learn to make a capture, download some OpenFlow captures.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `wget https://alta3.com/downloads/openflow_v1.3_messages.pcapng`

0. Launch Wireshark

    `click the wireshark icon on the bottom of the page`

0. When wireshark starts, click

    `File` then `Open`, then navigate to `Home` then `Student` then select file `openflow_v1_3_messages.pcapng`

0. Good job! You've opened a packet capture containing the OpenFlow protocol. However, right now, our focus is how to use Wireshark.

0. Now that we're no longer capturing packets, spend some time examining each of the three windows displayed. To clarify the separate windows, a screenshot has been included.

    - **Window 1 –** Top of the screen, displays the packet list (all of the captured packets are displayed here)
      - No. (Packet Number) – A relative number assigned to each packet captured
      - Time – A timestamp assigned to each packet captured.
        - Note: You can change the information Time displays by clicking: View > Time Display Format >
      - Source – A source IP address
      - Destination – A destination IP address
      - Protocol – The protocol associated with the captured packet (i.e. SIP, RTP, DNS, DHCP, etc.)
      - Length – Packet size (number of octets)
      - Info – Some information displayed by Wireshark about each packet.

    - **Window 2 –** Packet details (review packet details here)
  
    - **Window 3 –** Packet bytes (hex)

    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Windows](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark01.png)

0. We might not have much use for **Window 3** (hex), so let's ask Wireshark not to display that information. Click on **Edit > Preferences...**

    > See the screenshot below if you are lost.
  
    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Preferences](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark02.png)

0. Now click on **Appearances > Layouts**, and make sure **None** is selected under *Pane 3*.

    >
    See the screenshot below if you are lost.
  
    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Windows](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark03.png)

0. Wireshark doesn't do a great job of auto-resizing the windows. So take a moment and *adjust remaining window 1 and window 2*, so that they utilize the newly created freespace.

0. Suppose this is production traffic we wanted to save for analysis. Let's try saving the file. Navigate to **File > Save As...**

0. Write in the name **openflow_v1_3b** and then press the **Save** button.

    >
    See the screenshot below if you are lost.
  
    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Save File](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark05.png)

    >
    Note: Wireshark v1.x saves \*.pcap files by default, whereas Wireshark v2.x creates \*.pcapng (next-generation packet capture files).

0. Suppose we found just a few packets we wanted to save for further analysis. For now, let's say that information appeared in *packet number 16*, *packet number 17*, and *packet number 18*.

0. In the Packet List window, **identify column labeled “No.”**. This column represents the packet's *relative* capture number.

0. Find the packet labeled “No. 16”, and **right-click** it.

0. Select **Mark/Unmark Packet** in the resulting pop-up menu.

0. Find the packet labeled “No. 17”, and **right-click** it.

0. Select **Mark/Unmark Packet** in the resulting pop-up menu.

0. Find the packet labeled “No. 18”, and **right-click** it.

0. Select **Mark/Unmark Packet** in the resulting pop-up menu.

    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Marked Packets](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark06.png)

0. At this point, 3 packets will have been *marked*. To save only those packets, select **File > Export Specified Packets...**

0. In the pop-up window that opens, set the file name as, **openflow_v1_3c**

0. Now, make sure the **Marked packets only...** and **Displayed** selections are made at the bottom of the window.

0. Finally press the **Save** button.

    >
    See the screenshot below if you are lost.
  
    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Save Marked Packets](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark07.png)

0. Let's open the file we just created and see if it worked. Select **File > Open**

0. Select the file we just created, **openflow_v1_3c.pcapng**. You can *double left-click* it, or press the *Open* button.

0. Wireshark should open a packet capture file displaying only 3 packets.

    >
    See the screenshot below if you are lost.

    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Only 3 Packets](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark08.png)

0. Let's go back to our previous capture. Select **File > Open**

0. Select the original capture we downloaded, **openflow_v1_3.pcapng**. You can *double left-click* it or press the *Open* button.

0. Our original capture should open again (it has 174 captured packets).

    >
    See the screenshot below if you are lost.
  
    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Original File](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark09.png)  

0. So far we have learned to *Save* and *Open* Wireshark files. Now let's learn a little about *display filters*.

0.	Locate the *“Apply a Display Filter:”* textbox within Wireshark. It is located in the upper left corner.

0. This capture has OpenFlow v1.3 traffic. The filter expression to display OpenFlow v1.3 traffic is *openflow_v4*. In the filter expression, type: **openflow_v4** and then press the *enter* key.

    >
    See the screenshot below if you are lost.
  
    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Display Filter 01](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark10.png)   

0. Currently, only OpenFlow v1.3 traffic is being shown. To prove a point, change the *Display Filter* expression to **dns** and press the *Enter* key.

0. Nothing should appear as this capture does not contain any DNS traffic.

    >
    See the screenshot below if you are lost.
  
    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Display Filter 02](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark11.png)   

0. Delete the filter expression and press **Enter**. Alternatively, just press the **Clear button** (the X button which is far right side of where the Display Filter is set).

0. As we're going to use Wireshark more than once this week, we should take a moment to create a *Configuration Profile* so that our customized settings (filters, colors, etc.) can be saved.

0. Click **Edit > Configuration Profiles**

0. Click the **+** button to create a new profile, then type a unique profile name such as **SDN**

0. Click the **OK** button
  
    >
    See the screenshot below if you are lost.

    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Create Profile](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark12.png)

0.	The lower right-hand corner should now display, "Profile: SDN". From this point forward, all customization settings will persist by being auto-saved under this profile name.

    >
    See the screenshot below if you are lost.
  
    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark SDN Profile](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark13.png)
  

0. It is possible that *Pane 3* will return after you create a new profile. If that is the case, take a moment and remove *Pane 3* once again. Click on **Edit > Preferences...**, and then click on **Appearances > Layouts**, and make sure **None** is selected under *Pane 3*.

    >
    That's the last time we'll need to remove that pane. Creating a new profile intially returns all Wireshark settings to default. From here forward, all of our changes are being tracked in the *SDN* profile.

0. Time to customize some Wireshark colors. At the top of Wireshark, click **View > Coloring Rules…**

0.	A new window will open. Along the top it should say, “Wireshark: Coloring Rules – Profile: (your profile name)”

0.	Click the **+** button to create a new rule.

0.	In the *Name* box, type: **OpenFlowV4**

0.	In the *Filter* box, type: **openflow_v4**

0.	Click the *Background* color button. Choose a **light** color from the pop-up menu (dark colors will make it difficult to read).

0. Click the **OK** button when you're done.

0. Click the **OK** button again to finish setting a color filter for the OpenFlow protocol.

    >
    If you're lost, see the screenshot below.
  
    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark OpenFlow Color](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark14.png)

0. At this time, all of your OpenFlow packets should have your custom color set. If you don't like the color, feel free to modify the color scheme or create additional coloring rules you think may be helpful.

0. Find **packet “No. 1”**, and *right-click* it.

0. Select **Packet Comment...**

0. Write a custom comment. If you're not feeling particularly poetic, copy & paste the one below.

    ```
    Check out this OpenFlow packet!
         -Zach of Alta3 Research
    ```

0. Press the **OK** button when you've written in a custom message.

    >
    If you're lost, see the screenshot below.
  
    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Packet Comment](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark15.png)
  
0. Make sure you still have **packet "No.1"** selected. Then look at the packet details (window 2).

0. Expand the *Packet Comments* tree.

0. Your custom comment should be revealed.
  
    >
    If you're lost, see the screenshot below.
  
    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Opened Comment](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark16.png)  
  
    >
    Custom comments can be set and persist after saving within \*.pcap & \*.pcapng files.
  
0. Answer the following questions:

   - **Q1: When might it be useful to leave packet comments?**
     - A1: When working with colleagues or vendors to resolve issues, for teaching purposes, as reminders to yourself, etc.
   - **Q2: Can the \*.pcap files created with tcpdump be opened with Wireshark?**
     - A2: Yes!

0. If you notice, all of the IP addresses contained within this trace have a source and destination IP of *127.0.0.1*. Therefore, a *flow graph* won't be too interesting, but let's learn how to produce one anyways. We might want to use this feature later when looking at more complex traces.

0.	At the top of the Wireshark window within the menu, click: **Statistics > Flow Graph**

    >
    If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Flow Graph](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark17.png)
  
0. This graph would be more interesting if we had more than a single IP address (*127.0.0.1*) captured in our trace, but while we're here, identify the timestamp, IP column, and where ports are displayed.

0. Press the **Close** button when you're done to return to the main Wireshark screen.

0. The current *timestamp* being displayed by Wireshark is a little excessive (nano second resolution).

0. Within the top most menu, click: **View > Time Display Format > Hundredths of a Second**

0. The time column should now resolve to only two (2) decimal places.

0. Finally, let's learn to make a new live Wireshark capture.

0. Close Wireshark by clicking the “X” in the right corner, or click: **File > Quit**

0.	Within a terminal session, type the following to launch Wireshark:

    `start wireshark (click blue shark fin button on toolbar at the bottom of your screen)`

0. In the center left of the screen is a column labeled **Capture**.

0. *Double left-click* on the interface labeled as **‘any’**.

0. Packets should begin showing up in the trace.

0. At the top of the screen, find the the *shark fin* icon. Press it to begin capturing.

0. *Click* the **red square** (Stop button) to stop capturing packets.

0. Congratulations if this is your first Wireshark capture.

0. That's it for this lab! Good job! Spend some time playing with Wireshark. **Close all Wireshark windows when you've finished**.

    >
    Always make sure you **STOP** or **CLOSE** Wireshark when you're done using it. Endlessly capturing packets can result in poor performance.
