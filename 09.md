### TUESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to introduce the a tool that is included with Mininet, MiniEdit. MiniEdit is a simple GUI editor for Mininet. MiniEdit is an experimental tool created to demonstrate how Mininet can be extended. The purpose of learning this tool, is to demonstrate that you don't need to be a python coder to make complex Mininet topologies.

### Procedure

0. From your remote desktop, open a terminal session, and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`
    
0. MiniNet works great, provided you start and stop it correctly. Let's make sure MiniNet doesn't have any stale processes hanging around.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `sudo mn --clean`
    
    >
    To avoid issues in lab. Run the above command before and after running MiniNet or MiniEdit!

0. First, let's download MiniEdit.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `wget https://alta3.com/labs/files/miniedit.py`

0. Now, launch the MiniEdit tool.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo python miniedit.py`
    
0. MiniEdit has a simple user interface that presents a canvas with a row of tool icons on the left side of the window, and a menu bar along the top of the window. Your screen should look like the one below:

    ![Alta3 Research MiniEdit](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_miniedit01.png)

0. Now lets review the icons. From top to bottom...

    - **Select Tool** - Used to move nodes around on the canvas. Click and drag any existing node. Interestingly the Select tool is not needed to select a node or link on the canvas. To select an existing node or link, just hover the mouse pointer over it — this works regardless of the tool that is currently active — and then either right-click to reveal a configuration menu for the selected element or press the Delete key to remove the selected element.
    
    - **Host tool** - Creates nodes on the canvas that will perform the function of host computers. Click on the tool, then click anywhere on the canvas you wish to place a node. As long as the tool remains selected, you can keep adding hosts by clicking anywhere on the canvas. The user may configure each host by right-clicking on it and choosing Properties from the menu.
    
    - **Switch tool** - Creates OpenFlow-enabled switches on the canvas. These switches are expected to be connected to a controller. The tool operates the same way as the Hosts tool above. The user may configure each switch by right-clicking on it an choosing Properties from the menu.
    
    - **Legacy Switch tool** - Creates a learning Ethernet switch with default settings. The switch will operate independently, without a controller. The legacy switch cannot be configured and is set up with Spanning Tree disabled, so do not connect legacy switches in a loop.
    
    - **Legacy Router tool** - Creates a basic router that will operate independently, without a controller. It is basically just a host with IP Forwarding enabled. The legacy router cannot be configured from the MiniEdit GUI.
    
    - **NetLink tool** - Creates links between nodes on the canvas. Create links by selecting the NetLink tool, then clicking on one node and dragging the link to the target node. The user may configure the properties of each link by right-clicking on it an choosing Properties from the menu.
    
    - **Controller tool** - Creates a controller. Multiple controllers can be added. By default, the MiniEdit creates a mininet openFlow referencecontroller, which implements the behavior of a learning switch. Other controller types can be configured. The user may configure the properties of each controller by right-clicking on it and choosing Properties.
    
    - **Run & Stop buttons** - The Start button starts the Mininet simulation scenario currently displayed in the MiniEdit canvas, whereas the Stop button stops it. When MininEdit simulation is in the “Run” state, right-clicking on network elements reveals operational functiosn such as opening a terminal window, viewing switch configuration, or setting the status of a link to “up” or “down”.
    
0. First we will add some hosts to network scenario. Click on the Host icon, then move the pointer to the location on the MiniEdit canvas where you want the host to appear, then click again. A host icon will appear on the canvas.

0. As long as the Host tool is active, you can add more hosts. Keep clicking at each spot on the canvas where you want a host to appear. In this example, we will add ten hosts.

0. Add eight switches and three controllers using the same method: Click on the Switch tool and add switches, then click on the Controller tool and add controllers.

0. Next, add links between the nodes on the canvas. Click on the NetLink tool, then click on a node and drag the link over to another node. For example: connect a host to a switch, or a switch to another switch. Connect every host to at least one switch. Connect the switches together to create a network. Then, connect each switch to one of the controllers.

0. Your completed network should be similar to the network show in the screenshot below:

    ![Alta3 Research MiniEdit Network Finished](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_miniedit02.png)
    
0. We have three controllers. In this basic example, we will use the default OpenFlow Reference controller that comes built in to Mininet. However, we need to configure each controller so it uses a different port, as well as deploy our contollers as *OVS Contollers*

0. *Right-click* on each controller and select Properties from the menu that appears. The default port number for each controller is 6633. Change this so the port numbers used by controllers c0, c1, and c2 are 6633, 6634, and 6635, respectively. Also, set each to be an *OVS Contoller*.

    ![Alta3 Research MiniEdit Port Edit](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_miniedit03.png)

0. To set MiniEdit preferences, use the MiniEdit menu command, **Edit > Preferences**

0. In the dialogue box that appears, **uncheck** *OpenFlow v1.0*

0. **Check** *OpenFlow v1.3*

0. **Check** *Start CLI*.

    >
    If you do not make this check, then you will not be given the "mininet>" prompt when you click the Run button.

0. The MiniEdit Preferences are saved in the MiniEdit topology file for each scenario so you may have different preferences for each saved scenario. We will save the MiniEdit topology file so we can load this scenario into MiniEdit in the future. We will also export a Mininet Python script that we can run in a terminal window to execute the scenario.

0. To save the Mininet Topology (\*.mn) file, click on **File > Save** from the drop-down menu.

0. Save the as ***my_first_topo***, in the ***/home/student*** folder.

0. To save the Mininet Custom Topology (\*.py) file, click on **File > Save Level 2 Script** from the drop-down menu.

0. Save the as ***my_first_topo_py***, in the ***/home/student*** folder.

    >
    We'll get more experience with working with python scripts later. For now, we just want you to know that it is possible to produce Python code with MiniEdit.
    
0. To start the simulation scenario, *click the **Run** button* on the MiniEdit GUI. In the terminal window from which you started MiniEdit, you will see some messages showing the progress of the simulation startup and then the Miniedit CLI prompt (because we checked Start CLI box in the MiniEdit preferences window).

0. **READ THE WARNING MESSAGE**. In the future (not now), before stopping the simulation with the **Stop** button, ensure you quit from the CLI by typing `exit` at the Mininet prompt in the MiniEdit console window.

0. After starting the simulation scenario, we will view the status of different elements in the network, open terminal windows, run network traffic, run programs on simulated hosts, and simulate network failures. These activities will demonstrate how to use some of the features of MiniEdit.

0. First, check the switch configurations in the network simulation to verify that everything is set up correctly. Within the Mininet window, click **Run > Show OVS Summary** to see an listing of switch configurations. In this case, we can verify that each switch is listening to the correct controller on the correct port.

0. **Press *Enter*** to close the *Show OVS Summary* window.

0. *Right-click (and hold)* on *h1* and choose *terminal* from the drop down menu. If you do this command too quickly, the resulting dropdown menu will not pop up. So take your time. Hold down the right mouse button.

0. The resulting terminal is a terminal connected to the host *h1*. Let's launch *Wireshark* on this host. Type the following:

    `root@beachhead:~#` `wireshark &`

0. After just a moment, a *Wireshark* window will open. Click *OK* to bypass the error that pops up.

0. Now, *double-left-click* on the *any* interface to start capturing.

0. Back in the terminal you used to launch MiniEdit, type the following to start the *h1* host pinging the *h8* host.

    `mininet>` `h1 ping h8`
    
0. Wireshark should be recording the ICMP traffic. Wow! Amazing stuff!

0. First, *left-click (and hold)* on the terminal window you used issue the ICMP command. Press **CTRL + C** to stop the ping.

0. Now back in MiniEdit, *right-click* the link connecting *h8* to *s4*.

    >
    If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![Alta3 Research MiniEdit Right Click](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_miniedit04.png)

0. Choose **Link Down**.

    >
    If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![Alta3 Research MiniEdit Link Down](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_miniedit05.png)

0. Click the **Restart Capture** button in Wireshark (choose *No* if prompted to save your old capture).

    ![Alta3 Research MiniEdit Link Down](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_miniedit06.png)

0. Back in the terminal you used to launch MiniEdit, type the following to (once again) start the *h1* host pinging the *h8* host.

    `mininet>` `h1 ping h8`
    
0. Wow. Wireshark didn't capture anything. Cool! We just used software to simulate a link failure.

0. **Close** the Wireshark window (*click the X in the upper-right corner*).

0. Again, select the terminal window you used to launch MiniEdit, and press **CTRL + C** to stop the ping.

0. Exit MiniNet properly.

    `mininet>` `exit`
        
0. Press the **Stop** button in MiniEdit.

0. Click **File > Exit** in MiniEdit.

0. Cleanup Mininet properly.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo mn --clean`
    
0. An alternative to running a simulation directly in MiniEdit is to run a Mininet custom topology script created by MiniEdit. This is the file, *my_first_topo_py.py*, previously created when we used the menu command **File > Save Level 2 Script**. The advantage of running a Mininet custom topology script is that you can edit the script originally created by MiniEdit to create more complex scenarios and to use Mininet features not supported by MiniEdit. To run the custom topology you created in MiniEdit, execute the Mininet custom topology script.

0. Good job! You just used MiniEdit to create and run a simulation of a custom network topology, and learned how MiniEdit can be a useful tool for creating custom software-defined network simulation scenarios.
