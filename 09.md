### TUESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to introduce the a tool that is included with Mininet, MiniEdit. MiniEdit is a simple GUI editor for Mininet. MiniEdit is an experimental tool created to demonstrate how Mininet can be extended. The purpose of learning this tool, is to demonstrate that you don't need to be a python coder to make complex Mininet topologies.

### Procedure

0. From your remote desktop, open a terminal session, and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. First, let's download MiniEdit.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `wget https://alta3.com/labs/files/miniedit.py`

0. Now, launch the MiniEdit tool.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo python miniedit.py`
    
0. MiniEdit has a simple user interface that presents a canvas with a row of tool icons on the left side of the window, and a menu bar along the top of the window. Your screen should look like the one below

0. Now lets review the icons. From top to bottom...

    - **Select Tool** - Used to move nodes around on the canvas. Click and drag any existing node. Interestingly the Select tool is not needed to select a node or link on the canvas. To select an existing node or link, just hover the mouse pointer over it — this works regardless of the tool that is currently active — and then either right-click to reveal a configuration menu for the selected element or press the Delete key to remove the selected element.
    
    - **Host tool** - Creates nodes on the canvas that will perform the function of host computers. Click on the tool, then click anywhere on the canvas you wish to place a node. As long as the tool remains selected, you can keep adding hosts by clicking anywhere on the canvas. The user may configure each host by right-clicking on it and choosing Properties from the menu.
    
    - **Switch tool** - Creates OpenFlow-enabled switches on the canvas. These switches are expected to be connected to a controller. The tool operates the same way as the Hosts tool above. The user may configure each switch by right-clicking on it an choosing Properties from the menu.
    
    - **Legacy Switch tool** - Creates a learning Ethernet switch with default settings. The switch will operate independently, without a controller. The legacy switch cannot be configured and is set up with Spanning Tree disabled, so do not connect legacy switches in a loop.
    
    - **Legacy Router tool** - Creates a basic router that will operate independently, without a controller. It is basically just a host with IP Forwarding enabled. The legacy router cannot be configured from the MiniEdit GUI.
    
    - **NetLink tool** - Creates links between nodes on the canvas. Create links by selecting the NetLink tool, then clicking on one node and dragging the link to the target node. The user may configure the properties of each link by right-clicking on it an choosing Properties from the menu.
    
    - **Controller tool** - Creates a controller. Multiple controllers can be added. By default, the MiniEdit creates a mininet openFlow referencecontroller, which implements the behavior of a learning switch. Other controller types can be configured. The user may configure the properties of each controller by right-clicking on it and choosing Properties.
    
    - **Run & Stop buttons** - The Start button starts the Mininet simulation scenario currently displayed in the MiniEdit canvas, whereas the Stop button stops it. When MininEdit simulation is in the “Run” state, right-clicking on network elements reveals operational functiosn such as opening a terminal window, viewing switch configuration, or setting the status of a link to “up” or “down”.
    
0. First we will add some hosts to network scenario. Click on the Host icon, then move the pointer to the location on the MiniEdit canvas where you want the host to appear, then click again. A host icon will appear on the canvas.

0. As long as the Host tool is active, you can add more hosts. Keep clicking at each spot on the canvas where you want a host to appear. In this example, we will add ten hosts.

0. Add eight switches and three controllers using the same method: Click on the Switch tool and add switches, then click on the Controller tool and add controllers.

0. Next, add links between the nodes on the canvas. Click on the NetLink tool, then click on a node and drag the link over to another node. For example: connect a host to a switch, or a switch to another switch. Connect every host to at least one switch. Connect the switches together to create a network. Then, connect each switch to one of the controllers.

0. Your completed network should be similar to the network show in the screenshot below:
