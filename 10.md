### TUESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to explore how Mininet's unique application of network namespaces, so that we might futher our understanding of the namespace concept.

### Procedure

0. Let's start off with some basic questions.

   - **Q1: What is a network namespace?**
     - A1: A network namespace is logically another copy of the network stack, with its own routes, firewall rules, and network devices.
   - **Q2: Can there be more than one (1) network namespace?**
     - A2: Yes. By default a process inherits its network namespace from its parent. Initially all the processes share the same default network namespace from the init process.
   - **Q3: How can I "see" the network namespaces within the system?**
     - A3: By convention a named network namespace is an object at */var/run/netns/NAME* that can be opened. The file descriptor resulting from opening */var/run/netns/NAME* refers to the specified network namespace. Holding that file descriptor open keeps the network namespace alive.
   - **Q4: What do I need to 'install' to work with network namespaces?**
     - A4: Nothing. Network namespaces entered the Linux Kernel in 2.6.24 (~Jan 2009). From then it took about a year of further development before they were actually usable.

0. Take a moment and clean up your remote desktop. Close any terminals, Wireshark windows, or Firefox browser sessions you might have open.

0. From your remote desktop, open a terminal session, and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Enumerate the system **without** mininet running. First, display the current L2 configuration of the system.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip link list`

0. Now the L3 (IP) configuration of our current system with the *ip addr* command.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip addr show`

0. Finally, display the current state of routing.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip route show`

0. Save the output we just examined for future comparison. Write the output of *ip link list* to a new file called, *mn-ip-link-init*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip link list > /tmp/mn-ip-link-init`

0. Write the output of *ip addr show* to a new file called *mn-ip-addr-init*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip addr show > /tmp/mn-ip-addr-init`

0. Write the output of *ip route show* to a new file called *mn-ip-route-init*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip route show > /tmp/mn-ip-route-init`

0. Start a basic mininet topology.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo mn`
  
    ```
    *** No default OpenFlow controller found for default switch!
    *** Falling back to OVS Bridge
    *** Creating network
    *** Adding controller
    *** Adding hosts:
    h1 h2
    *** Adding switches:
    s1
    *** Adding links:
    (h1, s1) (h2, s1)
    *** Configuring hosts
    h1 h2
    *** Starting controller

    *** Starting 1 switches
    s1 ...
    *** Starting CLI:
    mininet>
    ```

0. Answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: How many virtual switches were just created?**
      - A1: One (1); switch2 (s1).
    - **Q2: How many hosts were just deployed?**
      - A2: Two (2); host1 (h1) and host2 (h2).

    >
    If you're confused, see the topography diagram below. This is what mininet just created:
  
    ```
     --------(s1)--------
     |                  |
    (h1)               (h2)
    ```
  
0. **Without** closing the current terminal, open a new, second terminal.

0. Enumerate the system **with** mininet running. First, display the current L2 configuration of the system.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip link list`

0. Now the L3 (IP) configuration of our current system with the *ip addr* command.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip addr show`

0. Finally, display the current state of routing.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip route show`

0. Save the output we just examined for future comparison. Write the output of *ip link list* to a new file called *mn-ip-link-basic*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip link list > /tmp/mn-ip-link-init`

0. Write the output of *ip addr show* to a new file called *mn-ip-addr-basic*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip addr show > /tmp/mn-ip-addr-init`

0. Write the output of *ip route show* to a new file called *mn-ip-route-basic*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip route show > /tmp/mn-ip-route-basic`

0. Just a little overlap from yesterday. Create a Linux *network namespace* called *myspace*. It's so easy!

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns add myspace`
  
0. Answer the following question:

    - **Q1: At this point, we have mininet running (h1, h2, & s1), and we just created a network namespace called *myspace*. How many network namespaces do you think are being tracked?**  
      - A1: Hard to say, since we're new at this, but probably a few. We created one (*myspace*), and then mininet probably created several more in which to run the hosts (h1 & h2), as well as the switch (s1). Afterall, namespaces are *really* easy to make with basic Linux tools!
    
0. Alright, run *ip netns list*. This command will reveal the namespaces within */var/run/netns*. Remember, we're thinking there's got to be more than just *myspace*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ip netns list`
  
    ```
    myspace (id: 0)
    ```

    - **Q1: Is this result suprising?**  
      - A1: Yes. Only the **myspace** network namespace was returned. All of this build-up seemed to indicate mininet creates additional network namespaces to make simple virtualization of hosts and networks.

0. You're actually understanding everything perfectly! Mininet **does** use network namespaces to make simple virutalization of hosts and networks possible.

0. First, delete that network namespace called *myspace*. We don't need it.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ip netns delete myspace`

0. Now, back to our investigation of mininet and network namespaces. Let's double check that the veth's that mininet created look like they are connected to a network namespace.

0. Switch back to the mininet terminal, and enumerate the host's networking. First L2 information associated with host1 (h1).

    `mininet>` `h1 ip link list`

    ```
    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1
        link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    2: h1-eth0@if197: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether de:5b:4a:82:0d:a8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    ```

    - **Q1: Is the L2 interface of the virtual ethernet adapter in an UP state?**
      - A1: Yes. In this example, *h1-eth0@if197* is listed as 'state UP'.
    - **Q2: There is also a valid MAC address applied?**
      - A2: Yes. This one would appear to have de:5b:4a:82:0d:a8, however, expect yours to be different.

0. Now the L3 (IP) information associated with host1 (h1).

    `mininet>` `h1 ip addr show`
  
    ```
    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1
        link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
        inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        inet6 ::1/128 scope host
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    2: h1-eth0@if197: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
        link/ether de:5b:4a:82:0d:a8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
        inet 10.0.0.1/8 brd 10.255.255.255 scope global h1-eth0
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        inet6 fe80::dc5b:4aff:fe82:da8/64 scope link
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    ```
  
    - **Q1: Has there been an L3 (IP) address applied to the virtual interface of host1 (h1)?**
      - A1: Yes. In this example, h1-eth0@if197 has the address 10.0.0.1.

0. Repeat the same steps for the host2 (h2). First the L2 information associated with host2 (h2)

    `mininet>` `h2 ip link list`
  
    ```
    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1
        link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    2: h2-eth0@if198: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether da:de:6a:aa:3e:cd brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    ```
  
    - **Q1: Is the L2 interface of the virtual ethernet adapter in an UP state?**
      - A1: Yes. In this example, *h1-eth0@if198* is listed as 'state UP'.
    - **Q2: There is also a valid MAC address applied?**
      - A2: Yes. This one would appear to have da:de:6a:aa:3e:cd, however, expect yours to be different.

0. Now the L3 (IP) information associated with host1 (h2).

    `mininet>` `h2 ip addr show`
  
    ```
    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1
        link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
        inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        inet6 ::1/128 scope host
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    2: h2-eth0@if198: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
        link/ether da:de:6a:aa:3e:cd brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
        inet 10.0.0.2/8 brd 10.255.255.255 scope global h2-eth0
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        inet6 fe80::d8de:6aff:feaa:3ecd/64 scope link
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    ```
  
    - **Q1: Has there been an L3 (IP) address applied to the virtual interface of host1 (h2)?**
      - A1: Yes. In this example, h2-eth0@if198 has the address 10.0.0.2.

0. Almost done! Display the L2 of the switch (s1).

    `mininet>` `s1 ip link list`
  
    ```
    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1
        link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    2: ens3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether fa:16:3e:59:a0:b8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    3: ens4: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether fa:16:3e:ac:cb:ff brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    11: ovs-system: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1
        link/ether ea:fb:5d:d4:53:b6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    196: s1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1
        link/ether a6:a3:5f:2d:a9:42 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    197: s1-eth1@if2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master ovs-system state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether f2:c8:9f:c4:7b:37 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 2
    198: s1-eth2@if2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master ovs-system state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether da:72:e3:67:ae:e8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 3
    ```

0. Last but not least, the L3 of the switch (s1).

    `mininet>` `s1 ip addr show`

    >
    Does this increase our hunch that these are implemented with network namespaces?
  
    `mininet>` `exit`

    It helps us to enumerate "nameless" network namespaces which are only attached to a PID (`/proc/<PID>/ns`)

0. Run the `listns.py` script before and after re-setting up a basic mininet topology

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo python listns.py`

0. 

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo python listns.py > mn-ns-init`
    
0. Start a basic Mininet topology
    
    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo mn`

0. Leave Mininet run.

    `mininet>`

0. Let Mininet run, in a new terminal, tpe the following

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`
    
0. Now type.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo python listns.py > mn-ns-basic`
    
0. Use *a3diff* to find out what changed.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `a3diff mn-ns-init mn-ns-basic`

0. Answer the following questions (your answers may be unique):

    - **Q1: What changed?**
    - **Q2: How many namespaces did Mininet create?**
    - **Q3: What types are they?**
    - **Q4: How many PIDs are they associated with?**
    - **Q5: What does a Mininet namespace represent?**

0. Connect to the mininet namespaces

  We can't connect to the namespaces with `ip netns exec [name]` because we dont have a name to connect to. Instead, we need to use *nsenter*, which can take a PID as an argument. Run these commands for both PID's returned by `listns.py`. This first command shows the L3 information of the namespace.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo nsenter -t <NAMESPACE PID> -n ip addr show`
    
0. This command shows the L2 information of the namespace.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo nsenter -t <NAMESPACE PID> -n ip link list`

0. Exit and cleanup

  `mininet>` `exit`

0. Don't forget to shut down Mininet properly.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo mn --clean`
    
0. Good job! That's it for this lab.
