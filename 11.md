### TUESDAY - &#x1F680;OPTIONAL&#x1F680;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to learn in detail what a *topology* is. You will look at a topology file and see exactly how a topology is encoded in Mininet using Python. The Python code is already written for you, so that you might study how topologoies are encoded without actually writing the code yourself. Advanced students are invited to write their own Python code, or augment the code included in this lab. This is an optional lab.

### Procedure

0. Take a moment to clean up your remote Desktop. For now, close all 

0. Read the below python code `custom-topology.py`

    ``` python
    """Custom topology example

       Two directly connected switches plus a host for each switch:

          host --- switch --- switch --- host

       Adding the 'topos' dict with a key/value pair to generate our newly defined
       topology enables one to pass in '--topo=mytopo' from the command line.
       """

    from mininet.topo import Topo

    class MyTopo( Topo ):
           "Simple topology example."

           def __init__( self ):
               "Create custom topo."

               # Initialize topology
               Topo.__init__( self )

               # Add hosts and switches
               leftHost = self.addHost( 'h1' )
               rightHost = self.addHost( 'h2' )
               leftSwitch = self.addSwitch( 's3' )
               rightSwitch = self.addSwitch( 's4' )

               # Add links
               self.addLink( leftHost, leftSwitch )
               self.addLink( leftSwitch, rightSwitch )
               self.addLink( rightSwitch, rightHost )


    topos = { 'mytopo': ( lambda: MyTopo() ) }

    ```

0. Copy this text into a file called topo1.py

0. Run mininet with the custom topology and test the connectivity

  * `sudo mn --custom topo1.py --topo mytopo`
  
0. Run a pingall command.

  * `pingall`

0. copy topo1.py to topo2.py
 
  * `cp topo1.py topo2.py`

0. Edit topo2.py so that the topology looks like the diagram below. We know this is **NOT** easy but give it a try anyhow. If you have no luck, go ahead and download the answer!  You can wget the answer in step 9 below. Another approach is to download the answer and see how our solution compares with yours.

  * change the class name to `NewTopo`
  * change the topology dictionary name to `newtopo`
  * modify and add links and switches to create the below topology

    ```
         h6    h5
           \  /
            s1
           /  \
          /    \
    h1--s2      s3--h4
       /          \
     h2            h3
    ```


0. Run mininet with the new custom topology and test the connectivity

  * `sudo mn --custom topo2.py --topo newtopo`
  * `pingall`

0. Here is our solution for the above topology. See if it matches your topology!

     `student@beachhead:~$` `wget -O ~/topo2.py https://alta3.com/static/files/topo2.py`

0. copy topo2.py to topo3.py and 

  * `cp topo2.py topo3.py`

0. make the following modifications to topo3.py:
  * change the class name to `RingTopo`
  * change the topology dictionary name to `ringtopo`
  * modify and add links and switches to create the below topology

    ```
         h6    h5
           \  /
            s1
           /  \
          /    \
    h1--s2------s3--h4
       /          \
     h2            h3

    ```

0. Run mininet with the new custom topology and test the connectivity

  * `sudo mn --custom topo3.py --topo ringtopo`
  * `pingall`

    >
    Why did this topology cause an error?
