### TUESDAY - &#x1F680;OPTIONAL&#x1F680;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to program Mininet with Python. It is an optional lab, recommended only for advanced students.

### Procedure

0. Take a moment to clean up your remote Desktop. For now, close all 

0. Read the below python code `custom-topology.py`

   ``` python
"""Custom topology example

   Two directly connected switches plus a host for each switch:

      host --- switch --- switch --- host

   Adding the 'topos' dict with a key/value pair to generate our newly defined
   topology enables one to pass in '--topo=mytopo' from the command line.
   """

from mininet.topo import Topo

class MyTopo( Topo ):
       "Simple topology example."

       def __init__( self ):
           "Create custom topo."

           # Initialize topology
           Topo.__init__( self )

           # Add hosts and switches
           leftHost = self.addHost( 'h1' )
           rightHost = self.addHost( 'h2' )
           leftSwitch = self.addSwitch( 's3' )
           rightSwitch = self.addSwitch( 's4' )

           # Add links
           self.addLink( leftHost, leftSwitch )
           self.addLink( leftSwitch, rightSwitch )
           self.addLink( rightSwitch, rightHost )


topos = { 'mytopo': ( lambda: MyTopo() ) }
   ```

0. Copy this text into a file called topo1.py

0. Run mininet with the custom topology and test the connectivity

  * `sudo mn --custom topo1.py --topo mytopo`
  
0. Run a pingall command.

  * `pingall`

0. copy topo1.py to topo2.py
 
  * `cp topo1.py topo2.py`

0. make the following modifications to topo2.py:

  * change the class name to `NewTopo`
  * change the topology dictionary name to `newtopo`
  * modify and add links and switches to create the below topology

  ```
         h6    h5
           \  /
            s1
           /  \
          /    \
    h1--s2      s3--h4
       /          \
     h2            h3
  ```


0. Run mininet with the new custom topology and test the connectivity

  * `sudo mn --custom topo2.py --topo newtopo`
  * `pingall`

0. copy topo2.py to topo3.py and 

  * `cp topo2.py topo3.py`

0. make the following modifications to topo3.py:
  * change the class name to `RingTopo`
  * change the topology dictionary name to `ringtopo`
  * modify and add links and switches to create the below topology

  ```
         h6    h5
           \  /
            s1
           /  \
          /    \
    h1--s2------s3--h4
       /          \
     h2            h3

  ```

0. Run mininet with the new custom topology and test the connectivity

  * `sudo mn --custom topo3.py --topo ringtopo`
  * `pingall`

    >
    Why did this topology cause an error?
