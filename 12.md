### WEDNESDAY - &#x1F528;OPTIONAL&#x1F528;

### Lab Objective

Throughout the rest of the course, you'll find our documentation uses the vim text editior, however, you may also use **vi** or **nano**. If you have not used either, Alta3 Research recommends you skip **nano** and learn to use **vim**.

  > Vim is the editor of choice for many developers and power users. It's a "modal" text editor based on the vi editor written by Bill Joy in the 1970s for a version of UNIX. It inherits the key bindings of vi, but also adds a great deal of functionality and extensibility that is missing from the original vi. 

  > In most text editors, the alphanumeric keys are only used to input those characters unless they're modified by a control key. In vim, the mode that the editor is in determines whether the alphanumeric keys will input those characters or move the cursor through the document. This is what is meant by 'modal'. When you first enter vim, you enter in the command mode.

### Procedure

0. Review (read-only) the following **vim** commands.

  - **To start editing changes by entering the \-\-INSERT\-\- mode:**
    - press `i`
  
  - **Top stop editing and return to command mode:**
    - press `ESC`

  - **To save and quit:** 
    - press `SHIFT` + `:`
    - press `wq` (writeout and quit)
    - press `ENTER` to confirm
    
  - **To quit without saving:**
    - press `SHIFT` + `:`
    - press `q!` (to quit)
    - press `ENTER` to confirm

0. From your remote desktop, open a terminal session, and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Now create a text file within the vim environment.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `vim nintendo.test`

0. You enter vim in command mode. To write text, you'll need to change to \-\-INSERT\-\- mode. To begin writing text, press:

  - `i`

0. Notice in the bottom left hand corner of the screen, it now says \-\-INSERT\-\-

0. Type a few sentences. Be sure to include some carriage returns, like the following:
 
  >
    Dear Mario,
  >
    Save me! Koopa has taken me to his castle.
  >
    Princess Toadstool
    
0. Okay, great! Now leave \-\-INSERT\-\- mode, and return to command mode, by pressing the escape key.
    - `ESC`

0. Notice that \-\-INSERT\-\- no longer is at the bottom left of the screen. Generally, pressing the escape key will always return you to the command mode.

0. Use the directional arrow keys on the keyboard to move the cursor around the screen.

0. Perform the following to save changes, and return to the command line.
    - press `SHIFT` + `:`
    - press `wq` (writeout and quit)
    - press `ENTER` to confirm

0. Confirm that the file did correctly save by printing its contents. We can use the **cat** command to catenate, or read data from files and print their contents to the screen.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `cat nintendo.test`

0. Edit the file *nintendo.test* again

    `student@beachhead:~$` `vim nintendo.test`

0. Remember, you enter vim in command mode. Take advantage of that and press the following capital letter to jump to the end of the file:

  - press `SHIFT` + `g`

0. Press the following capital letter to begin appending at the end of the line (enter \-\-INSERT\-\- mode at the end).

  - press `SHIFT` + `a`

0. You'll notice it says \-\-INSERT\-\- at the bottom left of your screen again. Once again you can type normally. Add some more text, such as the following:

  >
    Dear Mario,
  >
    Save me! Koopa has taken me to his castle.
  >
    Princess Toadstool
  >
    PS
  >
    "WELCOME TO ALTA3 LABS!"
  
0. Okay, great! Now leave \-\-INSERT\-\- mode, and return to command mode, by pressing the escape key.

  - `ESC`

0. Perform the following to return to the command line **without** saving any changes.
    - press `SHIFT` + `:`
    - press `q!` (quit without saving)
    - press `ENTER` to confirm

0. Confirm that none of the changes you just made were saved.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `cat nintendo.test`

0. Remove the file.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `rm nintendo.test`

0. Review a vim cheat sheet. These make very useful wall art, you may have seen one hanging in a colleague's workspace http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html

0. If you got stuck a few times, go back and try it again! Working within the vim environment is a basic Linux admin skill applicable to everyone that expects to work at the Linux CLI.
