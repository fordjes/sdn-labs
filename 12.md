### TUESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to use Wireshark to capture OpenFlow protocol as used by Mininet. We'll pass custom configurations to Mininet using the Ryu controller, operating on port 6653. Ryu is a component-based software defined networking framework. Ryu provides software components with well defined API that make it easy for developers to create new network management and control applications. Ryu supports various protocols for managing network devices, such as OpenFlow, Netconf, OF-config, etc.

### Procedure

0. Take a moment to clean up your remote Desktop. For now, close all other terminal spaces or windows you might have open.

0. Open a new terminal, then *cd* to the home student directory

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Download the python-code for our Ryu controller, name it *ss13.py*.  This is the code that makes a learning L2 switch.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `wget -O ss13.py https://alta3.com/labs/files/simple_switch_13.py`

0. List the code you just downloaded using the `cat` *(concatenate)* command. 

    `student@beachhead:~$` `cat ss13.py`

0. Make sure no process is hogging port TCP 6653.  If there is no response, you are good!

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo ss -plant | grep 6653`

    ```
    EXAMPLE ONLY, do not cut and paste this pid. It is just an example.
    LISTEN     0      10     *:6653        *:*        users:(("ovs-testcontrol",pid=10033,fd=3))
    ```

    >
    If a process is running, kill it with: `sudo kill <PID>` where PID is the pid= value.  

0. Start a Ryu controller with the file *ss13.py*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ryu-manager ss13.py`

0. Open a new terminal, then *cd* to the home student directory

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Launch Wireshark by clicking the wireshark button (blue shark fin) on toolbar at the bottom of the screen.

    `start wireshark (click blue shark fin button on toolbar at the bottom of your screen)`

0. Select **Capture > Options**

0. In the *Wireshark - Capture Interfaces* screen that pops up, *left-click* on the **any** interface.

0. In the *Enter a capture filter ...* box, type `port 6653`.

    - **Q1: What is running on port 6653?**
      - A1: The port of the Ryu control interface.

0. Click the Start button.


0. Open a new terminal, then *cd* to the home student directory

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Start a Mininet basic topology with connection to a 'remote' controller

  `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=6653`

0. Run the *pingall* command in Mininet.

    `mininet>` `pingall`

0. Stop the Wireshark capture by *left-clicking* the red square *stop* button.

0. There is only one IP address involved in this capture (127.0.0.1). So we want to set up Wireshark to display source port and destination port, *not* source IP and destination IP.

0. *Left-click* **Edit > Preferences**

0. In the resulting pop-up window, click **Appearance > Columns**

0. Columns can be added or removed with the **+** and **-** buttons at the bottom of the screen.

0. Use the **-** button (minus) to remove the columns that display:

    - Protocol - Protocol
    - Source - Source address
    - Destination - Destination address

0. The columns will appear in order that they appear in this list. Use the **+** button (plus) to add a column for **Source Port** and **Destination Port**. The objective is to have the following columns displayed **in this order**:

    - No. - Number
    - Time - Time (format as specified)
    - src port - Source port
    - dst port - Destination port
    - Info - Information

0. When you're done adjusting this window, it should look like the screenshot below:

0. In the *Display filter...* box, type: `openflow_v4` and then press *Enter* to apply the filter.

0. At this time, your *Wireshark* should look similar to the one below.

    ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Openflow Screen Setup](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark_openflow03.png)

0. In your resulting capture, click around to find the following types of OpenFlow packets.

0. Find the first packet in your OpenFlow capture. Expand the OpenFlow v1.3 tree in *window 2*.

0. Answer the following questions based off of this first OpenFlow capture:

    - **Q1: What is the first message in your OpenFlow capture?**
      - A1: OFPT_HELLO type (0)
    - **Q2: Who contacts who first?**
      - A2: Based on the OpenFlow, it is possible that it looks like the Controller contacted the switch first! Well, that's wrong. Continue on to find out why.

0. Change your *Display filter...* to: `((openflow_v4) or (tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0))`

    - **Q1: What does the above filter do?**
      - A1: TCP sessions are always preceded by a *SYN* message, the above filter will let us see that.
    - **Q2: How many times does the switch try to initiate a connection to the switch?**
      - A2: Twice. The first connection tests connectivity, the second will begin the OpenFlow session.

0. Look at the OpenFlow *OFPT_HELLO* messages. Use them to answer the following question: 

    - **Q1: What is exchanged in these messages?**
      - A1: Version compatibility.
    
0. Look at the OpenFlow *OFPT_FEATURES_REQUEST* messages. Use them to answer the following question: 

    - **Q1: Which device initiates an *OFPT_FEATURES_REQUEST*?**
      - A1: The controller.
    - **Q2: What was learned in the *OFPT_FEATURES_REPLY*?**
      - A2: Amount of buffers, amount of tables, along with statistics that may be available (flow, table, port, group, IP reasm, queue, port blocked). 

0. Click on the *OFPT_MULTIPART_REQUEST, OFPMP_PORT_DESC*. Answer the following questions:

   - **Q1: Who is sending this message?**
     - A1: The controller.
   - **Q2: What is this message asking?**
     - A2: This is the controller asking the switch to describe all of its ports.
   - **Q3: What message type (number) is this?**
     - A3: The type is (18).
   
0. Click on the *OFPT_MULTIPART_REPLY, OFPMP_PORT_DESC*. Answer the following questions:

   - **Q1: How many ports are there?**
     - A1: 3. Two are two physical ports and one reserved port.
   - **Q2: What are the ports names?**
     - A2: s1, s1-eth1, s1-eth2 
   - **Q3: What are the ports numbers?**
     - A3: The reserved port is `port no: OFPP LOCAL 0xfffffffe`, whereas the physical ports are `port no: 1`, and `port no: 2`.
   - **Q4: What does `port no: OFPP LOCAL 0xfffffffe` mean?**
     - A4: The reserved port is numbered, `port no: OFPP LOCAL 0xfffffffe`, which is the port on which the switch will get OpenFlow commands from the controller. 
   
0. Click on the first *OFPT_FLOW_MOD*. Answer the following questions:

   - **Q1: What is this message doing?**
     - A1: This is putting a *flow miss* rule in place with ultra low priority. This teaches the switch that the switch will take commands from the controller, and to send packets to the controller if it doesn't know how to route them.
   - **Q2: What is the *priority* of this message?**
     - A2: 0 (This represents lowest priority)
   - **Q3: What is the matching rule?**
     - A3: OFPMT_OXM (1) "OpenFlow Extensible Match"
   - **Q4: What is the type of action rule?**
     - A4: OFPAT_OUTPUT (0) - Output to switchport
   - **Q5: What port to be associated with the action?**
     - Q5: OFPP_CONTROLLER (0xfffffffd)

0. Click on the first *OFPT_PACKET_IN*. Answer the following questions based on what you are seeing in this packet:

   - **Q1: What is the Buffer ID?**
     - A1: We'll need this number so we can compare it to the next one. Yours will be unique!
   - **Q2: What was the total length?**
     - A2: Yours is likely 90, or somewhere close to that.
   - **Q3: What is the reason that this packet is being sent to the controller?**
     - A3: OFPR_NO_MATCH (0) - This is the switch's way of reporting to the controller that it doesn't know what to do with the packet.
   - **Q4: What type of packet is this?**
     - A4: Expand the data tree to find this information. There you'll see Internet Control Message Protocol IPv6.
   - **Q5: What port did it come in?**
     - A5: You can find this information by navigating to *OpenFlow v1.3 > Match > OXM field > IN_PORT > Value:* "X" (where X is the port this packet came in on)

0. Click on the first *OFPT_PACKET_OUT*. Answer the following questions based on what you are seeing in this packet:

    - **Q1: What is the Buffer ID?**
      - A1: This should match the value you recorded in the previous *OFPT_PACKET_IN*
    - **Q2: Who is sending this packet?**
      - A2: The controller is sending it to the switch.
    - **Q3: What is the *In port*?**
      - A3: This should match the port you found in the last question.
    - **Q4: What is the resulting action?**
      - A4: Send a packet to the flood port (all the ports except the ingress port). This can be seen in two places: The first describes the *what* to do. We can see this in the packet at *OpenFlow v1.3 > Action > Type > OFPAT_OUTPUT (0)*. The second describes the *where* to do it. We can see this in the packet at *OpenFlow v1.3 > Action > Port > OFPP_FLODD (oxfffffffb)*

0. Find the second or third *OFPT_FLOW_MOD*. Answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: What are the two match conditions applied to this flow mod?**
      - A1: To find the answer, navigate to: *OpenFlow 1.3 > Match > OXM field* (you'll find two OXM fields)
    - **Q2: What is the action?**
      - A2: The action described will be to send traffic out port 1 or 2. To find out which, navigate to: *OpenFlow 1.3 > Instruction > Action > Type & Port* 

0. Find a packet labeled *OFPT_ECHO_REQUEST*. *Left-click* the packet.

0. Open the OpenFlow 1.3 header.
  
0. Answer the following question based on what you're seeing displayed in the packet *OFPT_ECHO_REQUEST*:

    - **Q1: What type of message is this?**
      - A1: Type 2
    - **Q2: What is this message measuring?**
      - A2: It doesn't appear to be carrying any payload. So this is simply measuring latency. 

0. *Right-click* on the packet, and choose *Set/Unset Time Reference...*.

0. The difference between the *REF* and next number, is the time to Send / Receive the ECHO REQUEST & ECHO REPLY.

0. Start a new Wireshark capture. Don't save this one.

0. Once again, run the *pingall* command in Mininet.

    `mininet>` `pingall`

0. Go back to Wireshark, *stop* the capture.

0. Look at Wireshark, and notice that there are no new OpenFlow packets!

    - **Q1: Why is this? Why no new OpenFlow packets?**
      - A1: We didn't stop the relationship between the switch and the Ryu controller. The switch still knows how to deal with incoming ICMP packets.
    - **Q2: Any exceptions to this rule?**
      - A2: You might occasionally see an *OFPT_ECHO_REQUEST* and an *OFPT_ECHO_REPLY* to measure roundtrip delay, but no. If you keep running ping tests, you'll see no new traffic.
    
0. Good job! That's it for this lab. Congratulations if this is your first time checking out OpenFlow message flows.
