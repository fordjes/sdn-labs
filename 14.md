### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to teach how to build an SDN controller using the Ryu library. Think of Ryu as two parts: ryu-manager and ryu-application. The ryu-manager handles all the 'difficult' work of receiving packets (like OpenFlow packets). We then write logic, called ryu-applications, which instruct ryu-manager on how to behave to the packets its receiving. Ryu can do more than just OpenFlow, but Ryu does include an OpenFlow controller library. With it, we can make Ryu library calls that allow us to build an SDN OpenFlow controller. It may be worth reminding students that an SDN contoller is one that can receive information about packets and send flow mods / packets in response.

### Procedure

0. Okay, let's create a new file called *base.py*. This file will teach Ryu how to build the *skeleton framework* of a controller. It will not be able to make any modifications to the network fabric or any packet responses. The hope is that by evaluating this skeleton with Wireshark, we can see what ryu-manager provides us "out of the box", with only the minimum amount of code written / applied. Answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: What is the name of the ryu-application we're about to build?**
      - A1: base.py
    - **Q2: How are we going to evaluate what our code did?**
      - A2: Wireshark captures.

0. The ryu-manager runs ryu-applications. Ryu-manager does the hard work of receiving OpenFlow packets. We can write highly abstracted ryu-applications to instruct ryu-manager on how to behave to the OpenFlow packets it is receiving. Answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: How will ryu-manager behave if we don't program it with a ryu-application?**
      - A1: It will do nothing. Think of ryu-manager like a body and ryu-applciation like the higher brain functions for that body.
    - **Q2: I'm not a programmer. Can I still do this lab?**
      - A2: Yes. The code is highly commented for those of you that aren't programmers (comments begin with # symbols). If anything is unclear, just ask the instructor to review it with you.
    - **Q3: I'm not a programmer. How do I 'program'?**
      - A3: Great question! To write a ryu-application, we just need to create a file, then copy and paste the code into that file.

0. From your remote desktop, open a new terminal session and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. The text-editor we're about to use is called *vim*. The *vim* application is **V**i **IM**proved. If you've used Bill Joy's Unix text-editor, *vi*, then you'll be right at home with *vim*. Type the following command to create a new file, *base.py* and then keep reading for instructions on how to use *vim*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `vim base.py`

0. If this is your first time in the *vim* application, no problem. You're in a "modal" text editor. That means it has "modes". Right now, you're in *command* mode. You want to be in *--INSERT--* mode. To enter *--INSERT--* mode, press the **i** key.

0. In the lower-left of the screen, the word *--INSERT--* should be displayed.

0. Copy and paste the following ryu-application (code) into *vim*.

    ```
    # these import statements are the libraries required in order to access the functions we need
    from ryu.base import app_manager
    from ryu.controller import ofp_event
    from ryu.controller.handler import CONFIG_DISPATCHER, MAIN_DISPATCHER
    from ryu.controller.handler import set_ev_cls
    from ryu.ofproto import ofproto_v1_3

    # create a class for our app manager called 'L2Switch'
    # this means that ryu-manager will register this ryu-app
    class L2Switch(app_manager.RyuApp):

    # define the OpenFlow version this ryu-app will use
    # here we are saying that we want OpenFlow v1.3 to be used
        OFP_VERSIONS = [ofproto_v1_3.OFP_VERSION]

    # initialization incantation of this class (pass in args to self)
    # these next two lines ask calling function arguments to be passed to the initialization of our application (L2Switch) 
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(L2Switch, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
  
    # The ryu-manager will do the hardwork of recieving OpenFlow packets
    # If one of those packets is a switch features interrogation, the EventOFPSwitchFeatures will be created
    # ryu-manger will call this function because it has been registered for the event EventOFPSwitchFeatures
    # Handle switch feature interrogation event 
        @set_ev_cls(ofp_event.EventOFPSwitchFeatures, CONFIG_DISPATCHER)
        def switch_features_handler(self, ev):
    # The line below will have the ryu-app do nothing 
        return

    # Handle switch packet in event
        @set_ev_cls(ofp_event.EventOFPPacketIn, MAIN_DISPATCHER)
        def packet_in_handler(self, ev):
    # The line below will have the ryu-app do nothing 
        return
    ```

0. Press the **i** key to leave *--INSERT--* mode

0. Press the **:** key (requires holding SHIFT)

0. Type **wq** (writeout and quit) 

0. Press **ENTER**

0. Examine the code that you just created. It has been commented up to make it easy to understand! The following command will print it to the screen.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `cat base.py`

0. This code reflects the bare minimum OpenFlow v1.3 ryu-application to allow ryu-manager controller to function. Without this code, ryu-manager would refuse to process OpenFlow packets (of any version). However, this code does **not** teach our switch to send unknown packets, by default, to the controller. This would be typical behavior in a properly functioning OpenFlow switch, and is handled by sending the switch a *Flow-Mod* packet. We **will not** see that packet in this capture. We will correct this issue in a future lab. Answer the following question:

    - **Q1: What language are we programming in?**
      - A1: Python

0. Startup Wireshark and capture the packets which flow to/from the controller in this setup. This will require the use of three (3) separate terminal windows. The one we are currently using, we'll call *Terminal1*. Type the following in *Terminal1* to launch Wireshark.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo wireshark &`

0. Without closing the first terminal (*Terminal1*), open a second terminal (*Terminal2*). In the new second terminal, type the following:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ryu-manager ~/base.py`
    
    - If the above commands fail, you can try to issue `pkill -f ovs-testcontroller` as sometimes ovs-testcontroller is left on, and operating on the port 6653

0. Without closing the first terminal (*Terminal1*) or the second terminal (*Terminal2*), open a third terminal (*Terminal3*). In the new third terminal, type the following:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=6653`

0. Answer the below questions about the Wireshark capture:

    - **Q1: What openflow packets were sent / received from the controller?**
      - A1: OFPT_HELLO, OFPT_PORT_STATUS, OFPT_FEATURES_REQUEST, OFPT_FEATURES_REPLY, OFPT_MULTIPART_REQUEST (OFPMP_PORT_DESC), OFPT_MULTIPART_REPLY (OFPMP_PORT_DESC), OFPT_ECHO_REQUEST, OFPT_ECHO_REPLY
    - **Q2: As a result of seeing these of packets, what does the ryu manager automatically do for us without any code?**
      - A2: Without any code, the controller knows *about* the switch (and its ports), because ryu-manager (without any code from us), enumerated the switch. By using ryu-manager, all we need to do is bring the switch logic.
    - **Q3: If we ran `pingall` inside mininet would we see a PacketIn message to the controller? Why or why not?**
      - A3: No, we never set a default match on *any* packets, including an ICMP packet. No switches can forward any packets to the controller, because we don't have any Flow-Miss logic set (send the controller a packet when you don't know what to do with it).

0. Time to cleanup! First close Wireshark. Then in the terminal window you used to launch Wireshark (*terminal1*), type:

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`

0. In the terminal window you used to run the ryu-manager, (*terminal2*), press ** Ctrl + C** to stop ryu-manager.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `exit`

0. Now close the terminal window you used to launch ryu-manager.

0. Finally, in the mininet window (*terminal3*), type:

    `mininet> exit`
  
0. Then make sure mininet has exited all processes properly.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `sudo mn -clean`

0. Finally, close the last terminal.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`
  
0. Great job! That's it for this lab.
