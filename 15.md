### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to understand and demonstrate the initial flow modificaiton required for a functional OpenFlow 1.3 managed Switch. While this Switch will still not deliver our ICMP packets (pings), it will send Flow-Miss packets to the controller. Flow-Miss packets are how a Switch says, *'I don't know how to deliver this packet! Please send me a OFPT_PACKET_OUT (with an action) or a OFPT_FLOW_MOD (with a Flow) if you'd like me to learn what to do in this situation'*

### Procedure

0. So we want everyone to become a programmer. Over the next few steps, you'll be asked to augment *base.py* to become *fi.py*. Do your best here. If your code doesn't run, you can issue a *wget* statement and download a working version. Everyone will have success with this lab! 

    `student@beachhead:~$` `cp base.py fi.py`

0. We're going to use the *vim* editor to tweak our new file, *fi.py*. Remember, if you mess this up, you can always *wget* a working version. 

    `student@beachhead:~$` `vim fi.py`

0. Press the **i** key to enter *--INSERT--* mode.

0. Delete the word *return* on *line 28.*

0. Copy and paste the following code skeleton onto line 28. Each of these code comments should be proceeded by 4 spaces.

    ```
        # define shortened variables

        # match all packets

        # highest priority == lowest priority number

        # set action (forward packet to controller)

        # set the instruction to apply the action

        # formulate the final openflow packet

        # install the table-miss flow entry.

    ```

0. The idea is that we'll now add little code snippets below our new comments. Your job is to copy and paste the following code below the indicated comments. Ultimately, we're creating a function feature interrogation event handler. For each section below, find the comment from the skeleton and add the python code.

0. Create a set of shortened variable names for future use

    ```
        # define shortened variables
        msg = ev.msg
        dp = msg.datapath
        ofp = dp.ofproto
        ofp_parser = dp.ofproto_parser
    ```

0. Create a match rule that will be the default match for any packet  

    ```
        # match all packets
        match = ofp_parser.OFPMatch()

        # highest priority == lowest priority number
        pri = 0
    ```

0. Set the action which we want the switches to take.  In this case, send a non-buffered copy of the packet to the controller.

    ```
        # set action (forward packet to controller)
        actions = [ofp_parser.OFPActionOutput(ofp.OFPP_CONTROLLER, ofp.OFPCML_NO_BUFFER)]

        # set the instruction to apply the action
        inst = [ofp_parser.OFPInstructionActions(ofp.OFPIT_APPLY_ACTIONS, actions)]
    ```

0. Create a new flow modification type containing all the previously generated values
 
    ```
        # formulate the final openflow packet
        mod = ofp_parser.OFPFlowMod(datapath=dp, priority=pri, match=match, instructions=inst)
    ```

0. Send the resulting flow modification to the switch which just registered / interrogated the controller

    ```
        # install the table-miss flow entry.
        dp.send_msg(mod)
    ```

0. When you finish, press the **ESC** key to exit *--INSERT--* mode.

0. Issue the writeout & quit command (first press **:**, then **wq**, then press the **ENTER** key).

0. Startup Wireshark and capture the packets which flow to/from the controller in this setup. This will require the use of three (3) separate terminal windows. The one we are currently using, we'll call *Terminal1*. Type the following in *Terminal1* to launch Wireshark.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo wireshark &`

0. Without closing the first terminal (*Terminal1*), open a second terminal (*Terminal2*). In the new second terminal, type the following. If your code doesn't run, **KEEP READING** for two common solutions:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ryu-manager ~/fi.py`
    
    - If the above commands fail, you can try to issue `pkill -f ovs-testcontroller` as sometimes ovs-testcontroller is left on, and operating on the port 6653
    - If is possible your code was put together improperly. If you read the errors, its possible you can figure it out. Usually it is a indentation error. If you still can't figure it out, issue the follow command, then try again: `wget -O fi.py https://alta3.com/labs/files/fi.py`
    
0. Without closing the first terminal (*Terminal1*) or the second terminal (*Terminal2*), open a third terminal (*Terminal3*). In the new third terminal, type the following:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=6653`

0. Answer the below questions about the Wireshark capture:

    - **Q1: What OpenFlow packets were sent / received from the controller?**
      - A1: Same as last time, but now we also see a PacketIn.
    - **Q2: If we ran `pingall` inside mininet, would we see a PacketIn message to the controller?**
      - A2: Yes! That's the big change for this lab. The switch now has Flow-Miss logic provisioned. 
    - **Q3: Why does the `pingall` fail?**
      - A3: All we've done is install 'Flow-Miss' logic. We'll see a PacketIn packet sent from the switch to the controller, but we won't see any PacketOut come back from the controller to the switch. Furthermore, we don't have any code instructing the controller to send Flows in FlowMod packets to the switch.
    - **Q4: How are PacketOut and FlowMod packets different?**
      - A4: PacketOut contain actions which are single actions to take (i.e. 'do this right now'). FlowMod contain flows, which tell a switch how to begin to behave (and continue behaving).
    - **Q5: How are PacketOut and FlowMod packets the same?**
      - A5: They are both sent from a Controller to a switch. They both tell a switch about some behavior to take.

0. Time to cleanup! First close Wireshark. Then in the terminal window you used to launch Wireshark (*terminal1*), type:

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`

0. In the terminal window you used to run the ryu-manager, (*terminal2*), press ** Ctrl + C** to stop ryu-manager.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `exit`

0. Now close the terminal window you used to launch ryu-manager.

0. Finally, in the mininet window (*terminal3*), type:

    `mininet> exit`
  
0. Then make sure mininet has exited all processes properly.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `sudo mn --clean`

0. Finally, close the last terminal.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`
  
0. Great job! That's it for this lab.
