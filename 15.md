### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to understand and demonstrate the initial flow modificaiton required for a functional OpenFlow 1.3 managed Switch. While this Switch will still not deliver our ICMP packets (pings), it will send Flow-Miss packets to the controller. Flow-Miss packets are how a Switch says, *'I don't know how to deliver this packet! Please send me a OFPT_PACKET_OUT (with an action) or a OFPT_FLOW_MOD (with a Flow) if you'd like me to learn what to do in this situation'*

### Procedure

0. Take a moment and clean up your remote desktop. You can close any terminals or windows you have open within the remote environment.

0. Open a new terminal and then change to the home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Over the next few steps, you'll be asked to examine an augmented version of *base.py* to become *fi.py*. Do your best here. You might not be able to read python, but we've done our best to explain the code that you're going to execute. First, download the new augmented version of *base.py*, called *fi.py*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `wget -O ~/fi.py https://alta3.com/labs/files/fi.py`

0. The code we're about to examine add would be inserted into *line 28* of *base.py*. Print the code to the screen.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `cat ~/fi.py`

0. **This step is informational only**. The following code block is new. You'll find it right around *line 28*. This code creates a set of shortened variable names for future use

    ```
        # define shortened variables
        msg = ev.msg
        dp = msg.datapath
        ofp = dp.ofproto
        ofp_parser = dp.ofproto_parser
    ```

0. **This step is informational only**. The following code block is new. You'll find it right below the last. This code creates a match rule that will be the default match for any packet.

    ```
        # match all packets
        match = ofp_parser.OFPMatch()

        # highest priority == lowest priority number
        pri = 0
    ```

0. **This step is informational only**. The following code block is new. You'll find it right below the last. This code sets the action which we want the switches to take. In this case, send a non-buffered copy of the packet to the controller.

    ```
        # set action (forward packet to controller)
        actions = [ofp_parser.OFPActionOutput(ofp.OFPP_CONTROLLER, ofp.OFPCML_NO_BUFFER)]

        # set the instruction to apply the action
        inst = [ofp_parser.OFPInstructionActions(ofp.OFPIT_APPLY_ACTIONS, actions)]
    ```

0. **This step is informational only**. The following code block is new. You'll find it right below the last. This code creates a new flow modification type containing all the previously generated values
 
    ```
        # formulate the final openflow packet
        mod = ofp_parser.OFPFlowMod(datapath=dp, priority=pri, match=match, instructions=inst)
    ```

0. **This step is informational only**. The following code block is new. You'll find it right below the last. This code sends the resulting flow modification to the switch which just registered / interrogated the controller.

    ```
        # install the table-miss flow entry.
        dp.send_msg(mod)
    ```

0. Now, let's startup Wireshark and capture the packets which flow to/from the controller in this setup. This will require the use of three (3) separate terminal windows. The one we are currently using, we'll call *Terminal1*. Type the following in *Terminal1* to launch Wireshark.

    `start wireshark (click blue shark fin button on toolbar at the bottom of your screen)`
    
0. *Double-left click* to capture on the **any** interface to start capturing.

0. Set the *display filter* at the top of the screen to **openflow_v4**

0. Without closing the first terminal (*Terminal1*), open a second terminal (*Terminal2*). In the new second terminal, type the following:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ryu-manager ~/fi.py`
    
    - If the above commands fail, you can try to issue `pkill -f ovs-testcontroller` as sometimes ovs-testcontroller is left on, and operating on the port 6653
    
0. Without closing the first terminal (*Terminal1*) or the second terminal (*Terminal2*), open a third terminal (*Terminal3*). In the new third terminal, type the following:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=6653`

0. Answer the below questions about the Wireshark capture:

    - **Q1: What OpenFlow packets were sent / received from the controller?**
      - A1: Same as last time, but now we also see a PacketIn.
    - **Q2: If we ran `pingall` inside mininet, would we see a PacketIn message to the controller?**
      - A2: Yes! Try it! That's the big change for this lab. The switch now has Flow-Miss logic provisioned. 
    - **Q3: Why does the `pingall` fail?**
      - A3: All we've done is install 'Flow-Miss' logic. We'll see a PacketIn packet sent from the switch to the controller, but we won't see any PacketOut come back from the controller to the switch. Furthermore, we don't have any code instructing the controller to send Flows in FlowMod packets to the switch.
    - **Q4: How are PacketOut and FlowMod packets different?**
      - A4: PacketOut contain actions which are single actions to take (i.e. 'do this right now'). FlowMod contain flows, which tell a switch how to begin to behave (and continue behaving).
    - **Q5: How are PacketOut and FlowMod packets the same?**
      - A5: They are both sent from a Controller to a switch. They both tell a switch about some behavior to take.

0. Time to cleanup! First close Wireshark. Then in the terminal window you used to launch Wireshark (*terminal1*), type:

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`

0. In the terminal window you used to run the ryu-manager, (*terminal2*), press ** Ctrl + C** to stop ryu-manager.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `exit`

0. Now close the terminal window you used to launch ryu-manager.

0. Finally, in the mininet window (*terminal3*), type:

    `mininet> exit`
  
0. Then make sure mininet has exited all processes properly.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `sudo mn --clean`

0. Finally, close the last terminal.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`
  
0. Great job! That's it for this lab.
