### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to understand and demonstrate the initial flow modificaiton required for a functional OpenFlow 1.3 managed Switch.

### Procedure

0. make a copy of `base.py` called `fi.py` and replace the stub of the `switch_features_handler` with the skeleton provided 

    `cp base.py fi.py`

    ```
      # Handle switch feature interrogation event
      @set_ev_cls(ofp_event.EventOFPSwitchFeatures, CONFIG_DISPATCHER)
      def switch_features_handler(self, ev):

          # define shortened variables

          # match all packets

          # highest priority == lowest priority number

          # set action (forward packet to controller)

          # set the instruction to apply the action

          # formulate the final openflow packet

          # install the table-miss flow entry.

    ```

0. We will add the below python sections to `fi.py` in order to create a function feature interrogation event handler.  For each section below, find the comment from the skeleton and add the python code.

0. Create a set of shortened variable names for future use

    ```
        # define shortened variables
        msg = ev.msg
        dp = msg.datapath
        ofp = dp.ofproto
        ofp_parser = dp.ofproto_parser
    ```

0. Create a match rule that will be the default match for any packet  

    ```
        # match all packets
        match = ofp_parser.OFPMatch()

        # highest priority == lowest priority number
        pri = 0
    ```

0. Set the action which we want the switches to take.  In this case, send a non-buffered copy of the packet to the controller.

    ```
        # set action (forward packet to controller)
        actions = [ofp_parser.OFPActionOutput(ofp.OFPP_CONTROLLER, ofp.OFPCML_NO_BUFFER)]

        # set the instruction to apply the action
        inst = [ofp_parser.OFPInstructionActions(ofp.OFPIT_APPLY_ACTIONS, actions)]
    ```

0. Create a new flow modification type containing all the previously generated values
 
    ```
        # formulate the final openflow packet
        mod = ofp_parser.OFPFlowMod(datapath=dp, priority=pri, match=match, instructions=inst)
    ```

0. Send the resulting flow modification to the switch which just registered / interrogated the controller

    ```
        # install the table-miss flow entry.
        dp.send_msg(mod)
    ```

0. Startup Wireshark and capture the packets which flow to/from the controller in this setup.

  Terminal1: `sudo wireshark &`
  
  Terminal2: `ryu-manager base.py`

  Terminal3: `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=6653`

0. Answer the below questions about the Wireshark capture:

  * What OpenFlow packets were sent / received from the controller?
  * What new packets are coming from the switch as a result of the changes we made?
  * If we ran `pingall` inside mininet, would we see a PacketIn message to the controller?
  * Why or why not?
  * Why does the `pingall` fail?

0. Tear down

  * `mininet> exit`
  * quit Wireshark
  * Ctrl+C from ryu-manager
