### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to understand and demonstrate basic PacketIn and PacketOut OpenFlow mechanisms in a simple flooding switch (hub) 

### Procedure

0. make a copy of `fi.py` called `hub.py` and replace the stub of the `packet_in_handler` with the skeleton provided 

  `cp fi.py hub.py`

  ``` python
		# Handle packet in event
		@set_ev_cls(ofp_event.EventOFPPacketIn, MAIN_DISPATCHER)
		def packet_in_handler(self, ev):

				# register values into shorter variable names

				# create flood action

				# create response to packetin

				# actually send the packet to the requesting switch
  ```

0. We will add the below python sections to `hub.py` in order to create a simple flooding hub.  For each section below, find the comment from the skeleton and add the python code.

0. Create a set of shortened variable names for future use

  ```
				# register values into shorter variable names
				msg = ev.msg
				dp = msg.datapath
				ofp = dp.ofproto
				ofp_parser = dp.ofproto_parser
  ```

0. Create a flood action.  This tells the switch to send the packet which it asked the controller about to all ports on the switch except the one it came in on.

  ```
				# create flood action
				actions = [ofp_parser.OFPActionOutput(ofp.OFPP_FLOOD)]
	```

0. Create the response packet which will get sent to the switch containing all the values we setup

  ```
				# create response to packetin
				out = ofp_parser.OFPPacketOut(
						datapath=dp,
						buffer_id=msg.buffer_id,
						in_port=msg.match['in_port'],
						actions=actions
				)
  ```

0. Send the resulting `PacketOut` 

  ```
				# actually send the packet to the requesting switch
				dp.send_msg(out)
  ```

0. Startup wireshark and capture the packets which flow to/from the controller in this setup.

  Terminal1: `sudo wireshark &`
  
  Terminal2: `ryu-manager base.py`

  Terminal3: `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=6653`

0. Answer the below questions about the wireshark capture:

  * What openflow packets were sent / received from the controller?
  * What new packets are coming fromt he switch as a result of the changes we made?
  * If we ran `pingall` inside mininet would we see a PacketIn/PacketOut message to the controller?
  * Why or why not?
  * Why is this method of packet handeling inefficient? 
  * How could we make a better hub (without any mac address learning)?

0. Time to cleanup! First close Wireshark. Then in the terminal window you used to launch Wireshark (*terminal1*), type:

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`

0. In the terminal window you used to run the ryu-manager, (*terminal2*), press ** Ctrl + C** to stop ryu-manager.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `exit`

0. Now close the terminal window you used to launch ryu-manager.

0. Finally, in the mininet window (*terminal3*), type:

    `mininet> exit`
  
0. Then make sure mininet has exited all processes properly.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `sudo mn --clean`

0. Finally, close the last terminal.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`
  
0. Great job! That's it for this lab.
