### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to understand and demonstrate basic OFPT_PACKET_IN and OFPT_PACKET_OUT OpenFlow mechanisms in a simple flooding switch (hub). If we're successful, ICMP (pinging) should work! While this lab is really cool, we're still only making a hub. Hubs haven't been used in several decades, so, while we're learning how to design network functions with software, we're (admittedly) learning to make antiquated technology.

### Procedure

0. Take a moment and clean up your remote desktop. You can close any terminals or windows you have open within the remote environment.

0. Open a new terminal and then change to the home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Over the next few steps, you'll be asked to examine an augmented version of *fi.py*, called *hub.py*. Again, if you're not a python coder, no big deal. We've done our best to explain the code that you're going to execute. First, download the new file, *hub.py*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `wget -O ~/hub.py https://alta3.com/static/files/hub.py`

0. The code we're about to examine add would be inserted into *line 28* of *base.py*. Print the code to the screen.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `cat ~/hub.py`

0. **This step is informational only**. The following code block is new. You'll find it near the end of the file. This code creates a set of shortened variable names for future use.

    ``` python
        # register values into shorter variable names
        msg = ev.msg
        dp = msg.datapath
        ofp = dp.ofproto
        ofp_parser = dp.ofproto_parser
    ```

0. **This step is informational only**. The following code block is new. You'll find it near the end of the file. Create a flood action.  This tells the switch to send the packet which it asked the controller about to all ports on the switch except the one it came in on.

    ``` python
        # create flood action
        actions = [ofp_parser.OFPActionOutput(ofp.OFPP_FLOOD)]
    ```

0. **This step is informational only**. The following code block is new. You'll find it near the end of the file. Create the response packet which will get sent to the switch containing all the values we setup

    ``` python
        # create response to packetin
        out = ofp_parser.OFPPacketOut(
                         datapath=dp,
                         buffer_id=msg.buffer_id,
                         in_port=msg.match['in_port'],
                         actions=actions
			 )
    ```

0. **This step is informational only**. The following code block is new. You'll find it near the end of the file. Send the resulting *OFPT_PACKET_OUT*.

    ``` python
        # actually send the packet to the requesting switch
        dp.send_msg(out)
    ```

0. Startup Wireshark and capture the packets which flow to/from the controller in this setup. This will require the use of three (3) separate terminal windows. The one we are currently using, we'll call *Terminal1*. Type the following in *Terminal1* to launch Wireshark.

    `start wireshark (click blue shark fin button on toolbar at the bottom of your screen)`
    
0. *Double-left click* to capture on the **any** interface to start capturing.

0. Set the *display filter* at the top of the screen to **openflow_v4**

0. Without closing the first terminal (*Terminal1*), open a second terminal (*Terminal2*). In the new second terminal, type the following:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ryu-manager ~/hub.py`
    
    - If the above commands fail, you can try to issue `pkill -f ovs-testcontroller` as sometimes ovs-testcontroller is left on, and operating on the port 6653
    
0. Without closing the first terminal (*Terminal1*) or the second terminal (*Terminal2*), open a third terminal (*Terminal3*). In the new third terminal, type the following:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=6653`

0. Answer the below questions about the Wireshark capture:

    - **Q1: What new packets are coming fromt he switch as a result of the changes we made?**
      - A1: PACKET_OUT
    - **Q3: If we ran `pingall` inside Mininet would we see a OFPT_PACKET_IN / OFPT_PACKET_OUT message to the controller?**
      - A3: Yes. Try it!
    - **Q4: Why or why not?**
      - A4: We added code that teaches the controller how to respond to this perticular OFPT_PACKET_IN
    - **Q5: Why is this method of packet handeling inefficient?**
      - A5: Every packet encountered by the switch is causing a OFPT_PACKET_IN to be sent to the controller. 
    - **Q6: How could we make a better hub (without any mac address learning)?**
      - A6: Send an OFPT_FLOW_MOD packet from the controller to the switch. 

0. Time to cleanup! First close Wireshark. Then in the terminal window you used to launch Wireshark (*terminal1*), type:

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`

0. In the terminal window you used to run the ryu-manager, (*terminal2*), press ** Ctrl + C** to stop ryu-manager.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `exit`

0. Now close the terminal window you used to launch ryu-manager.

0. Finally, in the mininet window (*terminal3*), type:

    `mininet> exit`
  
0. Then make sure mininet has exited all processes properly.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `sudo mn --clean`

0. Finally, close the last terminal.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`
  
0. Great job! That's it for this lab.
