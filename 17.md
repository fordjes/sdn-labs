### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to understand and demonstrate logic behind a simple layer 2 switch as implemented in ryu. This lab builds on the previous two (2) labs.

### Procedure

0. From your remote desktop, open a new terminal session and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Download the `simple_flood_13.py` ryu-application

    `student@beachhead:/$` `wget -O sf13.py https://alta3.com/labs/files/simple_flood_13.py`
 
0. Open and read the downloaded file.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `view sf13.py +"set number"`

0. Answer the following questions about the ryu-application

    - **Q1: Which events will be handled inside the SimpleSwitch13 class?**
      - A1: OFPSwitchFeatures, OFPPacketIn
    - **Q2: What parameters does the add_flow function take?  Why is this function used?  When does this function get called?**
      - A2: Datapath, Prioirty, Match, Actions, Buffer Id
      - A2: It is used to make adding flows to our switch easier (we don't have to type out lines 52-64 every time)**
      - A2: Lines 49
    - **Q3: What type of Ethernet packet is our PacketIn handler ignoring?**
      - A3: LLDP (see lines 82-84)
    - **Q4: What variable is the controller using to store known MAC addresses? Where is this variable initialized? Where do new addresses get added?**
      - A4: mac_to_port is the variable used to store known MAC addresses
      - A4: mac_to_port is initalized to an empty set at line 31**
      - A4: mac_to_port values are "learned" and set to the in port on line 94
    - **Q5: When does the controller look up the a MAC address in mac_to_port?  What action does it take if it is/is not found?**
      - A5: On line 96 the PacketIn handler looks for the destination mac address in mac_to_port
      - A5: If the MAC address is found the packet is instructed to be forwarded to the appropriate port on the switch
      - A5: If the MAC address is not found the packet is instructed to be flooded on all ports

0. Startup Wireshark and capture the packets which flow to/from the controller in this setup. This will require the use of three (3) separate terminal windows. The one we are currently using, we'll call *Terminal1*. Type the following in *Terminal1* to launch Wireshark.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo wireshark &`

0. Without closing the first terminal (*Terminal1*), open a second terminal (*Terminal2*). In the new second terminal, type the following:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ryu-manager ~/base.py`
    
    - If the above commands fail, you can try to issue `pkill -f ovs-testcontroller` as sometimes ovs-testcontroller is left on, and operating on the port 6653
    - If is possible your code was put together improperly. If you read the errors, its possible you can figure it out. Usually it is a indentation error. If you still can't figure it out, issue the follow command, then try again: `wget -O ~/base.py https://alta3.com/labs/files/base.py`

0. Without closing the first terminal (*Terminal1*) or the second terminal (*Terminal2*), open a third terminal (*Terminal3*). In the new third terminal, type the following:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=6653`

0. Answer the below questions about the wireshark capture:

    - **Q1: Find the two types of PacketOut messages we described above: FLOOD and Port Specific.  What is the port number for the FLOOD port?**
      - A1: `0xfffffffb` (see [flowgrammable](http://flowgrammable.org/sdn/openflow/ports/#tab_ofp_1_3_3) for more info)
    - **Q2: What packets get generated when you run a `pingall`?**
      - A2: A PacketIn and a PacketOut for each ICMP packet
    - **Q3: What could be improved about this controller?**
      - A3: While we are no longer flooding on packets that we know their destination port, the controller is still involved in the processing of every packet.
      - A3: The next lab will seek to fix this by adding flows to the switches.
