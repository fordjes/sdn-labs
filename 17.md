### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to understand and demonstrate logic behind a simple layer 2 switch as implemented in ryu. This lab builds on the previous three (3) labs.

### Procedure

0. From your remote desktop, open a new terminal session and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Download the *simple_flood_13.py* ryu-application, but name it locally as *sf13.py*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `wget -O ~/sf13.py https://alta3.com/labs/files/simple_flood_13.py`
 
0. Print the contents of *sf13.py* to the screen.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `cat sf13.py`

0. Answer the following questions about the ryu-application

    - **Q1: Which events will be handled inside the SimpleSwitch13 class?**
      - A1: OFPSwitchFeatures, OFPPacketIn
    - **Q2: What parameters does the add_flow function take?  Why is this function used?  When does this function get called?**
      - A2: Datapath, Prioirty, Match, Actions, Buffer Id
      - A2: It is used to make adding flows to our switch easier (we don't have to type out lines 52-64 every time)
      - A2: Lines 49
    - **Q3: What type of Ethernet packet is our PacketIn handler ignoring?**
      - A3: LLDP (see lines 82-84)
    - **Q4: What variable is the controller using to store known MAC addresses? Where is this variable initialized? Where do new addresses get added?**
      - A4: mac_to_port is the variable used to store known MAC addresses
      - A4: mac_to_port is initalized to an empty set at line 31
      - A4: mac_to_port values are "learned" and set to the in port on line 94
    - **Q5: When does the controller look up the a MAC address in mac_to_port?  What action does it take if it is/is not found?**
      - A5: On line 96 the PacketIn handler looks for the destination mac address in mac_to_port
      - A5: If the MAC address is found the packet is instructed to be forwarded to the appropriate port on the switch
      - A5: If the MAC address is not found the packet is instructed to be flooded on all ports

0. Startup Wireshark and capture the packets which flow to/from the controller in this setup. This will require the use of three (3) separate terminal windows. The one we are currently using, we'll call *Terminal1*. Type the following in *Terminal1* to launch Wireshark.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo wireshark`
    
0. *Double-left click* to capture on the **any** interface to start capturing.

0. Set the *display filter* at the top of the screen to **openflow_v4**

0. Without closing the first terminal (*Terminal1*), open a second terminal (*Terminal2*). In the new second terminal, type the following:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ryu-manager ~/sf13.py`
    
    - If the above commands fail, you can try to issue `pkill -f ovs-testcontroller` as sometimes ovs-testcontroller is left on, and operating on the port 6653

0. Without closing the first terminal (*Terminal1*) or the second terminal (*Terminal2*), open a third terminal (*Terminal3*). In the new third terminal, type the following:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=6653`

0. Answer the below questions about the wireshark capture:

    - **Q1: Find the two types of PacketOut messages we described above: FLOOD and Port Specific.  What is the port number for the FLOOD port?**
      - A1: `0xfffffffb` (see [flowgrammable](http://flowgrammable.org/sdn/openflow/ports/#tab_ofp_1_3_3) for more info)
    - **Q2: What packets get generated when you run a `pingall`?**
      - A2: A PacketIn and a PacketOut for each ICMP packet
    - **Q3: What could be improved about this controller?**
      - A3: While we are no longer flooding on packets that we know their destination port, the controller is still involved in the processing of every packet.
      - A3: The next lab will seek to fix this by adding flows to the switches.
      
0. Time to cleanup! First close Wireshark. Then in the terminal window you used to launch Wireshark (*terminal1*), type:

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`

0. In the terminal window you used to run the ryu-manager, (*terminal2*), press ** Ctrl + C** to stop ryu-manager.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `exit`

0. Now close the terminal window you used to launch ryu-manager.

0. Finally, in the mininet window (*terminal3*), type:

    `mininet> exit`
  
0. Then make sure mininet has exited all processes properly.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `sudo mn --clean`

0. Finally, close the last terminal.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`
  
0. Great job! That's it for this lab.
