### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to understand and demonstrate logic behind a simple layer 2 switch as implemented in ryu. This lab builds on the previous four (4) labs.

### Procedure

0. From your remote desktop, open a new terminal session and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Download the `simple_switch_13.py` ryu-application, but name it locally *ss13.py*

    `student@beachhead:/$` `wget -O ss13.py https://alta3.com/labs/files/simple_switch_13.py`
 
0. Open and read the downloaded file.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `view ss13.py +"set number"`

0. Answer the following questions about the ryu-application

    - **Q1: What portion of this ryu application is different from the previous ryu applicaiton (`sf13.py`)?**
      - A1: Lines 104-112

0. Let's isolate these changes and look at only those lines:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `diff sf13.py ss13.py`

    - **Q1: What are these lines trying to accomplish?**
      - A1: Add a new flow to the switch which allows it to "learn" the destination MAC address to port mappings.

0. Startup Wireshark and capture the packets which flow to/from the controller in this setup. This will require the use of three (3) separate terminal windows. The one we are currently using, we'll call *Terminal1*. Type the following in *Terminal1* to launch Wireshark.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo wireshark &`

0. Without closing the first terminal (*Terminal1*), open a second terminal (*Terminal2*). In the new second terminal, type the following:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ryu-manager ~/ss13.py`
    
    - If the above commands fail, you can try to issue `pkill -f ovs-testcontroller` as sometimes ovs-testcontroller is left on, and operating on the port 6653

0. Without closing the first terminal (*Terminal1*) or the second terminal (*Terminal2*), open a third terminal (*Terminal3*). In the new third terminal, type the following:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=6653`

0. Answer the below questions about the wireshark capture:


    - **Q1: Find the two types of PacketOut messages we described above: FLOOD and Port Specific. How many Flood packets did we see?**
      - A1: There should only be two.  One for each of the two MAC addresses on the switch.
    - **Q2: What packets get generated when you run a `pingall`?**
      - A2: A PacketIn and a PacketOut for each ICMP packet
    - **Q3: On subsiquent `pingall`s are there additional PacketIn messages to the controller? Why or why not?**
      - A3: No, the installed flows have allowed the switch to handle the traffic without reaching out to the controller for help.
      
0. Time to cleanup! First close Wireshark. Then in the terminal window you used to launch Wireshark (*terminal1*), type:

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`

0. In the terminal window you used to run the ryu-manager, (*terminal2*), press ** Ctrl + C** to stop ryu-manager.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `exit`

0. Now close the terminal window you used to launch ryu-manager.

0. Finally, in the mininet window (*terminal3*), type:

    `mininet> exit`
  
0. Then make sure mininet has exited all processes properly.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `sudo mn --clean`

0. Finally, close the last terminal.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`
  
0. Great job! That's it for this lab.
