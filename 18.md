### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to understand and demonstrate logic behind a simple layer 2 switch as implemented in ryu. This lab builds on the previous four (4) labs.

### Procedure

0. From your remote desktop, open a new terminal session and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Download the `simple_flood_13.py` ryu-application

    `student@beachhead:/$` `wget -O ss13.py https://alta3.com/labs/files/simple_switch_13.py`
 
0. Open and read the downloaded file.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `view ss13.py +"set number"`

0. Answer the following questions about the ryu-application

    - **Q1: What portion of this ryu application is different from the previous ryu applicaiton (`sf13.py`)?**
      - A1: Lines 104-112

0. Let's isolate these changes and look at only those lines:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `diff sf13.py ss13.py`

    - **Q1: What are these lines trying to accomplish?**
      - A1: Add a new flow to the switch which allows it to "learn" the destination MAC address to port mappings.

0. Startup wireshark and capture the packets which flow to/from the controller in this setup.

    Terminal1: `sudo wireshark &`
    
    Terminal2: `ryu-manager sf13.py`

    Terminal3: `sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=6653 --mac`

0. Answer the below questions about the wireshark capture:

    - **Q1: Find the two types of PacketOut messages we described above: FLOOD and Port Specific. How many Flood packets did we see?**
      - A1: There should only be two.  One for each of the two MAC addresses on the switch.
    - **Q2: What packets get generated when you run a `pingall`?**
      - A2: A PacketIn and a PacketOut for each ICMP packet
    - **Q3: On subsiquent `pingall`s are there additional PacketIn messages to the controller? Why or why not?**
      - A3: No, the installed flows have allowed the switch to handle the traffic without reaching out to the controller for help.
