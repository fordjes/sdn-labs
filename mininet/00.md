### TUESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to introduce how to use Wireshark for packet capture and decoding. Wireshark is essentially TCPdump, only with a GUI. Just like TCPdump, it too can writeout, open, and manipulate packet capture files (.pcap). In this lab, you will learn how to use Wireshark to listen on interfaces, set display filters, create a Wireshark profile so you can save your layout customization (color, windows placement, etc.), colorize packets by protocol, and set-up a friendly environment for capturing the OpenFlow protocol. Wireshark is an industry standard tool; the lessons learned within this lab are directly applicable within many production environments.

### Procedure

0. Take a moment to clean up your remote Desktop. For now, close all other terminal spaces or windows you might have open.

0. Open a new terminal, then *cd* to the home student directory

  `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. The Wireshark Wiki has many sample captures available for download. Before we learn to make a capture, download some OpenFlow captures.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `wget -O openflow_v1_3.pcapng.gz "https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCapturesaction=AttachFile&do=get&target=openflow_v1.3_messages.pcapng.gz"`

0. Decompress the file we just downloaded with the Linux program, *gunzip*.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `gunzip openflow_v1_3.pcapng.gz`

0. Launch Wireshark, and open the openflow capture file, *openflow_v1_3.pcapng*.

  `student@beachhead:~$` `wireshark openflow_v1_3.pcapng`
  
0. Good job! You've opened a packet capture containing the OpenFlow protocol. However, right now, our focus is how to use Wireshark.

0. Now that we're no longer capturing packets, spend some time examining each of the three windows displayed. To clarify the seperate windows, a screenshot has been included.

  - **Window 1 –** Top of the screen, displays the packet list (all of the captured packets are displayed here)
    - No. (Packet Number) – A relative number assigned to each packet captured
    - Time – A timestamp assigned to each packet captured.
      - Note: You can change the information Time displays by clicking: View > Time Display Format >
    - Source – A source IP address
    - Destination – A destination IP address
    - Protocol – The protocol associated with the captured packet (i.e. SIP, RTP, DNS, DHCP, etc.)
    - Length – Packet size (number of octets)
    - Info – Some information displayed by Wireshark about each packet.

  - **Window 2 –** Packet details (review packet details here)
  
  - **Window 3 –** Packet bytes (hex)

0. We might not have much use for **Window 3** (hex), so let's ask Wireshark not to display that information. Click on **Edit > Preferences...**

  > See the screenshot below if you are lost.
  
  ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Preferences](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark02.png)

0. Now click on **Appearances > Layouts**, and make sure **None** is selected under *Pane 3*.

  See the screenshot below if you are lost.
  
  ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Windows](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark03.png)

0. Wireshark doesn't do a great job of auto-resizing the windows. So take a moment and *adjust remaining window 1 and window 2*, so that they utilize the newly created freespace.

0. Suppose this is production traffic we wanted to save for analysis. Let's try saving the file. Navigate to **File > Save As...**

0. Write in the name, **openflow_v1_3b** and then press the, **Save** button.

  ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Save File](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark05.png)

  >
  Note: Wireshark v1.x saves \*.pcap files by default, whereas Wireshark v2.x creates \*.pcapng (next-generation packet capture files).

0. Suppose we found just a few packets we wanted to save for further analysis. For now, let's say that information appeared in *packet number 16*, *packet number 17*, and *packet number 18*.

0. In the Packet List window, **identify column labeled “No.”**. This column represents the packet's *relative* capture number.

0. Find the packet labeled “No. 16”, and **right-click** it.

0. Select **Mark/Unmark Packet** in the resulting pop-up menu.

0. Find the packet labeled “No. 17”, and **right-click** it.

0. Select **Mark/Unmark Packet** in the resulting pop-up menu.

0. Find the packet labeled “No. 18”, and **right-click** it.

0. Select **Mark/Unmark Packet** in the resulting pop-up menu.

  ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Save File](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark06.png)

0. At this point, 3 packets will have been *marked*. To save only those packets, select **File > Export Specified Packets...**

0. In the pop-up window that opens, set the file name as, **openflow_v1_3c**

0. Now, make sure the **Marked packets only...** and **Displayed** selections are made at the bottom of the window.

0. Finally press the **Save** button.

  See the screenshot below if you are lost.
  
  ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Save File](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark07.png)

0. Let's open the file we just created and see if it worked. Select **File > Open**

0. Select the file we just created, **openflow_v1_3c.pcapng**. You can *double left-click* it, or press the *Open* button.

0. Wireshark should open a packet capture file displaying only 3 packets.

  >
  See the screenshot below if you are lost.

  ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Save File](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark08.png)

0. Let's go back to our previous capture. Select **File > Open**

0. Select the origial capture we downloaded, **openflow_v1_3.pcapng**. You can *double left-click* it, or press the *Open* button.

0. Our original capture should open again (it has 174 captured packets).

  See the screenshot below if you are lost.
  
  ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Save File](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark09.png)  

0. So far we have learned to *Save* and *Open* Wireshark files. Now let's learn a little about *display filters*.

0.	Locate the *“Apply a Display Filter:”* textbox within Wireshark. It is located in the upper left corner.

0. This capture has OpenFlow v1.3 traffic. The filter expression to display OpenFlow v1.3 traffic is *openflow_v4*. In the filter expression, type: **openflow_v4** and then press the *enter* key.

  >
  See the screenshot below if you are lost.
  
  ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Display Filter 01](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark10.png)   

0. Currently, only OpenFlow v1.3 traffic is being shown. To proove a point, change the *Display Filter* expression to **dns** and press the *Enter* key.

0. Nothing should appear, as this capture does not contain any DNS traffic.

  >
  See the screenshot below if you are lost.
  
  ![Alta3 Research Wireshark Display Filter 02](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_sdn_wireshark11.png)   

0. Delete the filter expression, and press **Enter**. Alternatively, just press the **Clear button** (the X button which is far right side of where the Display Filter is set).

0. As we're going to use Wireshark more than once this week, we should take a moment to create a *Configuration Profile*, so that our customized settings (filters, colors, etc.) can be saved.
